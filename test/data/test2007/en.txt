1	Our declaration of rights is the first of this millennium.
2	Let us, as a Europe of 15 Member States, organise ourselves in order to be able to welcome those countries who are knocking at the door into the fold under respectable conditions.
3	Provision for social, cultural and charitable causes must be included in Article 87 so that the future of these important institutions can also be permanently safeguarded.
4	Some people think that it is possible to create an internal market in Europe without agreeing on fundamental values and principles.
5	I too would like to welcome Mr Prodi' s forceful and meaningful intervention.
6	You will be aware that this was a deliberate decision taken in Amsterdam to clearly distinguish the two roles, with the High Representative, as opposed to the Commission, not speaking from a completely independent viewpoint, but under a remit to coordinate the common foreign and security policies that lie within the competence of the Member States, and there we should leave perhaps ample scope for an intergovernmental approach.
7	He wanted the Presidency to outline the way forward at Nice.
8	One could indeed wish for more and for improvement, but I honestly believe that we have made a good start.
9	I therefore hope that the Nice European Council will associate itself with this project and decide to launch it as a practical project rather than an accomplished fact once, of course, the reforms of which we are currently in need have been adopted.
10	However, I also specified clearly that, as things stand at the moment, we can achieve extremely important objectives through the Community method as it is today, for example, to improve our action in the Balkans.
11	Only if we bind Russia to the West and to the European Union will we also be able to bring an influence to bear on its policies and remain in contact and in discussion with Russia.
12	Motion for a resolution (B5-0767/00) by Mr Napolitano on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights
13	He is currently continuing this genocide and moreover he is also trying to completely eliminate the freedom of the media and the rule of law in Russia, which, as it is, barely exist.
14	In order to do something to meet the expectations of this pensioner, who is called Giuseppe Italia, lives in Cremona and would love to be able to sail on the Po, I voted for the Piecyk report, which concerns the expansion and development of sea and inland ports and intermodal terminals.
15	The result of the voting in this House makes the objective of the directive - which was recognised and supported by all the speakers and the Commission - unattainable.
16	Mr President, I voted for the Skinner report, as I explained during the debate before the vote, because I feel that risk capital is important.
17	My colleague Mrs Armonie Bordes cuttingly pointed out yesterday that only a minority benefit from deploying community capital and pension premiums for entrepreneurial risks.
18	The Charter will, consequently, be used more to enshrine the current practices, including the reactionary practices, of the national States than to represent genuine progress.
19	Mr President, at last we have a Charter of the rights of the European citizen with an entire article - Article 25 - dedicated to the elderly.
20	This text may initially seem benign, since it basically reiterates existing rights, but if it were to be incorporated into the treaty and to be made binding, as the European Parliament is urging, it would automatically tend to standardise national legal systems in Europe; it would give the Court of Justice disproportionate power; it would promote increased centralisation around the European institutions; it would restrict every nation' s margin for autonomous decision making.
21	Â· The Charter should not be overloaded with detailed rules; these should remain the preserve of subordinate law.
22	I shall be voting for an alternative charter by participating in the demonstrations in Biarritz on 13 and 14 October and in Nice on 7 December 2000.
23	Progress towards accession by the 12 candidate countries
24	In my opinion, even today there are a number of Member States which have still not understood that this link exists, and that the slow progress in the Intergovernmental Conference might make it very difficult for us to bring about enlargement in the necessary time frame.
25	We will only be able to achieve all the objectives which I have mentioned so far if politicians and the elite both in the applicant countries and in the European Union - and in this limited context I agree with you, Commissioner - finally advertise the fact that the enlargement of the European Union is actually of benefit to Europe itself too.
26	That is the wording adopted.
27	Let me now mention the second guideline along which the Presidency hopes the enlargement process will develop in these six months.
28	What I therefore propose is to work towards this, bearing in mind that, with a view to 2003, we shall have to examine which candidates are ready to join us at that time.
29	I should like to thank the rapporteur of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, Mr Brok, for his clear, comprehensive report.
30	There is no single case in the negotiations in which it is a question of "if" ; it is only a question of "how" and "when" .
31	But they have also done so because the prospect of membership of the European Union gives them hope of solidarity with the people of Europe and because they are being offered a firm political and economic foothold.
32	A number of countries have made such good progress with the second economic criterion of their ability to compete in the single market that they are fast reaching the point at which they are ready for accession.
33	We are therefore looking to coordinate as closely as possible with the programmes of national governments, Parliament and other institutions.
34	Every year - and this is shortly to happen again, on 8 November - each candidate country awaits with bated breath the judgement of the Commission with regard to the progress made.
35	We were right in opting for the principle of differentiation, whereby each candidate country is assessed on its own merits.
36	This debate is a further opportunity for my group to reaffirm its view that the accession of the central and eastern European countries, but also of Cyprus and Malta, is the best way of safeguarding the future for all of us in Europe both in the East and in the West.
37	It is a matter of the utmost importance and yet has curiously attracted very little public attention.
38	People joke that after the collapse of the Berlin Wall enlargement is always just five years away.
39	The next natural opportunity would be the European parliamentary elections that follow in 2009, but we would like to push for as many countries as possible joining in 2004.
40	Furthermore, there are six basic aspects which worry us because of the method employed.
41	In actual fact, the thing we are rushing into is the very model of the construction of Europe, by which I mean to say the simultaneous integration of all sectors of activity whatever the traditions or special characteristics of the individual sectors, which once again has turned into a trap.
42	The way in which this almost universal feeling found expression in Central and Eastern Europe in the late 80s still merits our gratitude to this day.
43	To make matters clear, however, there can be no accession on the cheap.
44	This contains a powerful idea, which is also a fine idea, namely that we shall not carry out enlargement in the face of opinion and that, effectively, the best way to carry out enlargement with the assent of opinion is by involving it in elections, since elections are the expression of democracy and the citizens' means of gaining access to the political system.
45	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should just like to say a few words about the sine qua non for the scenario which many here have called for.
46	I would be most surprised if they did not exert any pressure.
47	But, as I have already indicated, all the countries are approaching the point at which they will be ready for accession relatively quickly.
48	In other words liberalisation of the trade in agricultural products has already been agreed and the Poles are not worried that Polish agriculture will collapse as a result.
49	There have been strains but, on the whole, peace and trade have established a closer association between people, now further consolidated by means of the currency union.
50	It must be the results of the negotiations which count.
51	The only amendment which has already been tabled is covered in my report, but I am pleased that the Greens wish to emphasise the importance of treating citizens equally.
52	This does not just mean a law for the civil service; it also means giving young civil servants opportunities and paying them a decent wage.
53	That applies to both Latvia and the European Union.
54	There are plans to peg the litas to the euro in the second half of 2001.
55	Mr President, Commissioner, Poland, the country for which I am rapporteur, is the largest and most important of the countries which are preparing to enter the European Union, but it is also, as we know, the most problematic, so much so that there have been rumours that it might be excluded from the first group, the group of countries which are to join the Union first.
56	There are too many promises which we have made to Poland, the countries of Eastern Europe, the former Communist countries, and failed to keep.
57	There is still one point which crops up constantly when talk turns to the Czech Republic and that is the problem of the Roma.
58	Slovakia has not been condemned to the second division and it is logical that it should like to join together with the Czech Republic.
59	On a final note, I would like to take the liberty of making one comment on Slovakia' s home affairs policy.
60	Thirdly, with regard to agriculture, which has a lower level of productivity than in the European Union, we need to ensure that the agricultural market is fully opened up to the capital that is necessary for land privatisation, for the modernisation of farms and marketing structures and for improving yields.
61	Bulgaria is anxious to join the European Union and NATO.
62	Acute poverty has been a key problem in Romania since 1990 and under the present government, the economy is at last showing real signs of improvement.
63	I call upon the new parliament, which will take up office a fortnight from now, and the new government to make these matters a priority.
64	We must however also point out that the definitive solution, a fair and lasting solution, must fully comply with both the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions, with this being, quite simply, the international law in force, and also the principles governing the European Union.
65	Malta also has stable, working, democratic institutions.
66	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we wish to make our contribution to this debate.
67	I must say, I personally have been particular impressed with the success of Hungary, Estonia and Slovenia here.
68	This change places heavy demands on the people in the candidate countries but, at the same time, it guarantees their future and their children' s future.
69	Particular attention - and here I agree with the previous speaker - needs to be paid to border regions.
70	The Commission should not be left to fend for itself here.
71	The candidate countries want to experience quick economic growth, even if this is at the expense of previously stipulated nature protection policy.
72	We had a two-way traffic of bad habits, many of them linked to health.
73	. (ES) Mr President, enlargement is essential for the construction of a strong and united European continent.
74	The European Parliament and its Committee on Regional Policy, which also has competence in the field of transport and the Trans-European Networks, is aware that it is necessary to coordinate the different Community sectoral policies in favour of a global policy of regional planning.
75	But first a reminder that transport infrastructure will be instrumental to the success of enlargement.
76	Mr President, I would join the chorus of those who say that the forthcoming enlargement is now the main task of the EU.
77	A great deal of pressure has been placed upon traditional social values in the former planned economies of Central and Eastern Europe.
78	The PPE-DE does not want to take on the responsibility for pacing accession from the candidates because we cannot set any dates in this respect.
79	The second point concerns the setting of dates.
80	There is another reason.
81	Thirdly, acceptance of enlargement and its positive prospects for the individual countries and for the EU as a whole basically depend - and Denmark demonstrated this - on dismantling the social and democratic deficits of European policy.
82	Populism is how technocrats choose to denigrate the will of the people when it is expressed in a direction which does not suit them.
83	Ladies and gentlemen, we shall now stop for a break and something to eat and shall resume at 9 o' clock.
84	Albeit in a somewhat longer time-scale, we shall be obtaining a common currency for the whole continent.
85	Internal battles are being sparked off in the individual countries over these issues.
86	We call on them to fight for a different Europe of all the people, a Europe without this inhumane side, in which people will defend their destiny and live with each other in peace, freedom, comradeship and mutually beneficial cooperation.
87	I publicly commend the work of these and, in particular, the Romanian Challenge Appeal based in Birmingham and others from Ireland supported by a number of people including Daniel O'Donnell, the Irish entertainer, who has pledged GBP 1 million and has raised that in Ireland and other parts of the world.
88	Above all, the Nice Summit must clarify whether, and how, the EU, for its part, can get itself completely ready for enlargement in good time.
89	The Polish people are asking themselves whether they will receive these payments once they are members of the EU, or whether they are regarded as second-class citizens.
90	However, I am sure that, with good will and the help of the European Union, a solution can be found which will allow the two communities to live together peaceably and prosper, as they have done for centuries.
91	We have also addressed the issue of minorities, because the integration of these minorities - including their linguistic integration - in these countries, is also of significance.
92	The requirement for becoming an EU Member State is that of complying with the basic Copenhagen criteria.
93	We heard about the benefits of enlargement, and this is one of the issues where we can learn from Lithuania.
94	Imagine if they were all like that!
95	Mr President, Commissioner, I too should like to thank and congratulate Mr Brok and the other rapporteurs, but I would mainly like to focus on Slovakia and the policy on minorities, to be more specific.
96	I urge you to set a deadline in Nice by which you intend to conclude negotiations with those candidate countries - naming no names - that have made the most progress.
97	The European Union must continue to help Bulgaria in its progress towards joining the Union and, of course, to ensure that the planning of that aid becomes even more decentralised.
98	The dialogue between the social partners, the other groups within civil society, the government and parliament will play an important - and as we see it - positive part in the process.
99	We are just doing away with a divided Europe, and we are not going to create a new one now.
100	All this is to be found in the report by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne, and on behalf of my group, I would like to thank her warmly for this report.
101	In this sense, I think that, if anything, it will be Cyprus on which Europe' s ability to look itself in the face politically will be judged.
102	I myself live close to the Baltic, which matters to us all.
103	The political vision endures.
104	So it was very cheering to hear Klaus HÃ¤nsch, speaking for the PSE Group, hope that he Commission would make a real appraisal of the effects of enlargement, including the economic impact if enlargement were not to take place.
105	However, in common with our rapporteur, Mr Wuermeling, I believe that it would not be in the interests of either party to the treaty for there to be no transitional periods, and being a delegate from a border region, who, like Mrs Schierhuber, owns a farm in the vicinity of the Czech border, it is a matter of concern to me that the formation of close, common economic areas should be managed without any major problems, and lead to a positive outcome on both sides.
106	As a Social Democrat, there are three points I would like to highlight.
107	This would mean greater commitment to the implementation of EU legislation than what is required in the present convergence agreements.
108	Secondly, say no to the big bang idea of incorporating candidate countries simultaneously as a large group, since that would militate against the principle that each country should be admitted on its own merits.
109	Thirdly, we must do our utmost to prepare the European Union for the enlargement process, by 2003, in the spirit of the splendid speech made by President of the Commission, Mr Prodi.
110	I should like to refer to the relations between Parliament and the Council and to highlight the fact that there have recently been considerable delays in the Council's replies to our written questions.
111	It is worrying that this can happen in a country which is going to join the European Union.
112	I ask it to be sent back to committee for preparation.
113	Mr President, today we are to discuss, and perhaps vote on, a total of three reports which deal with this subject, two of them mine.
114	This is something which everyone at each stage in the food chain should in fact help with.
115	There will be a price to pay for safe food at every stage in the chain.
116	We must therefore join Mrs Paulsen and the Commission and adopt the principle of non-dilution in order to make animal nutrition safe and to effectively protect European consumers.
117	The 1999 Directive was well thought-out, and it has already scored its first success by demonstrably reducing pollution levels.
118	But it is not the answer simply to permit blending.
119	Very briefly, we must insist on Amendment No 37, concerning dioxins.
120	On this point we are in agreement.
121	As a result, we European consumers will find ourselves continuing to buy meat and milk and their derivatives that are produced on the world markets using animal feedingstuffs which are in no way subject to the thresholds and limit values defined by the European Union, under a system which allows raw materials to be acquired on the international markets, where producers are free to mix all types of ingredients and formulations before selling their products on Union territory.
122	By the second reading we need to have the Commission's view on how the risk assessment will be carried out.
123	However, it would be unfortunate if, for example, Amendments 39 and 40 were adopted, for this would mean that the opportunities for Member States to intervene quickly to combat newly discovered dangers would disappear.
124	Consumer safety begins with animal feed, with its ingredients, the declaration and, last but not least, the official inspections.
125	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Paulsen' s report on undesirable substances and products in animal nutrition deals with an important subject, which, like all important subjects, is highly controversial.
126	The discussion on Mrs Paulsen' s sound report was emotionally charged at times, and I believe that now, with this discussion behind us, we can assume that, although the requirements prescribed for the feed industry are strict, we can ensure that by admixture, the quality will change in future.
127	Individually and collectively, these three proposals will address major shortcomings brought to light by the dioxin crisis.
128	Amendment No 33 deletes the possibility of exporting non-complying consignments to the country of origin.
129	Amendments Nos 41, 42, 43 and 44, proposing to reintroduce the possibility of dilution under certain conditions of contaminated feed materials are also unacceptable.
130	This should be sufficient, considering our commitment to establish a rapid alert system covering all the food and feed chain in the new proposal on the food authority.
131	Commissioner Byrne, in this directive on the marketing of compound feed we find our old problem lurking, namely the question of open declarations.
132	So that in itself has already made my morning.
133	So if we were to do what we intend, if we were to implement it quickly and then pass quickly through the codecision procedure too, that would certainly be a huge step forward, and I feel sure that we shall be very strong and united in our dealings with the Council.
134	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it can still happen, or at least it cannot be ruled out, that contaminated primary products will find their way into animal feed again at some future juncture.
135	The BSE scandal was the worst and most notorious example.
136	Common sense, as our rapporteur said, would suggest that labelling should make a clean sweep and list all the ingredients.
137	I believe the specialised knowledge and the powers of judgement of the members of the Agriculture Committee on farming matters, and hence on animal nutrition too, are beyond question and that the Agriculture Committee is therefore the body which is best qualified to arrive at a practical and practicable solution that the farmers in question will apply and which consumers will understand.
138	This is the good news.
139	In my opinion, this is a legitimate right to information which must be satisfied.
140	On my own behalf and on behalf of my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries, I would ask you, Madam President, to send Parliament' s condolences to the families of the victims and to the local authorities in both Brittany and in MarÃ­n, Galicia, from where the majority of the victims came.
141	(Parliament adopted the resolution)
142	Are there any objections to this oral amendment being tabled?
143	That is how the rapporteur explained matters to us.
144	Most of the report' s technical amendments deserve our wholehearted support, for example, those on food safety, the dismantling of first generation nuclear power stations, environmental protection, the fight against social dumping and the crucial code of conduct for Western businesses operating in the East, etc. The task is huge and also a matter of the utmost priority.
145	At the same time, there are still considerable difficulties to overcome, particularly in terms of budgets.
146	Enlargement with the addition of thirteen countries changes not only the geopolitical framework of the European Union, but also its structure, because the total population will increase (by 28%), but so will the number of 'disadvantaged' regions.
147	We should also do well to remember that, because of the great economic and social significance of farming and its output, a competitive agricultural and food-supply structure will be a vitally important factor in the success of these countries' transformation and restructuring processes.
148	For this reason, I hope that the outermost regions, six out of seven of which always feature amongst the ten poorest in the EU, benefit from the Structural Funds, no longer just according to the sole criterion of GDP but also according to geographical, demographic and, especially, social indicators.
149	Because we reject this Europe in the interests of the French people, we cannot in all conscience endorse its enlargement to include the countries and the peoples of the East, which have only just emerged from Communist dictatorship and cannot yet know what a technocratic and totalitarian trap it is that they are wanting to enter.
150	We should have made do with the country reports, adding at most a short, yet succinct resolution.
151	The current system of subsidies, grants and quotas must be replaced by free trade and adaptation to the market.
152	The size and breadth of the problems raised by enlargement are incompatible with the duplicitous language that has been used about it within the European Union.
153	For me, enlargement is not a question of whether to endorse the entry of certain countries into Europe.
154	Our neighbouring country has struggled with determination over the last decade to meet the criteria of membership.
155	Latvia is entitled to its place in this forum, not only because, on the whole, the progress it has made has earned it the right to this 'allocation of confidence' that is essential in order to successfully concluded negotiations of this type, but more especially, and above all, because Latvia is at home in Europe as a European country.
156	I feel that, out of all the States which have applied to join the Union, Poland is the one which most deserves our support and our commitment for, without Poland's crucial initiatives, Communism would not have ended and we would not be discussing this issue today.
157	This is not perhaps quite so obvious to the Polish population which is still generally very Euro-sceptical.
158	I call on Prague to respond to this signal, this challenge, this plea for dialogue, to grant our request and to ensure, together with our House, that this legacy of a nationalist era can be consigned to the past.
159	I welcome the Wiersma report on Slovakia's application for membership of the European Union and share the majority of conclusions that he draws.
160	I welcome this opportunity to extend a warm greeting to the pensioners and elderly people of the Bulgarian Republic.
161	If Romania continues to make progress and the European Union adjusts its institutional structure and policies in order to cope with enlargement I can see no reason why Romania should not be admitted to the Union.
162	Whatever the solution on settlers, and it is a thorny issue along with land restitution on both sides, this is too harsh without giving a qualification.
163	Unfortunately some of the comments made in the draft report on the application by Cyprus for membership of the European Union by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy are not helpful.
164	It is not going to be an easy task, given the lack of good will on the part of the Turkish Cypriot side and of Turkey.
165	Stenzel Report (A5-0243/2000)
166	I was, alas, the victim of an - albeit mild - dose of food poisoning, brought on, I regret to say, by eating at the European Parliament.
167	For all these reasons I voted in favour of the ban on dilution proposed by the European Commission.
168	We must urge the ASEM countries in this resolution to pressurise the military regime in Burma to restore democracy.
169	We are partial in our approach and application.
170	This is no time for the faint-hearted.
171	A few important points in the directive are, firstly, the rules on the burden of proof.
172	Equal treatment and non-discrimination are fundamental principles of the EU.
173	" That is why we need anti-discrimination legislation.
174	Partly thanks to this, we now have a large number of legal, technical amendments before us which aim to guarantee a level of equal protection against discrimination on the basis of race on the one hand and on the basis of religion, handicap, age and sexual orientation on the other.
175	Balance, moderation and legal expertise were required and I believe that his report reflects those qualities.
176	In addition, their view is that cases of discrimination are not so numerous as to warrant any legislation.
177	There is not enough money in the action programme to replace that work which takes place in the fifth framework which will hopefully continue in any other framework programmes, but we need to make sure they work together.
178	Everyone is agreed that discrimination should be fought but opinions differ as to how, to what extent and by what means.
179	In committee, I have had occasion to make a stand against the fact that there may also be experts outside NGOs that have something to say.
180	We are also delighted with the provision in the directive which stipulates that equal treatment for the disabled also means that companies are expected to make the necessary adjustments within the workplace.
181	Only then can we effectively combat discrimination in all the fields of human life.
182	After all, as the great democracies of the English-speaking world teach us, racism and discrimination must be fought with liberal democracy, not by restrictions and the gradual erosion of freedom of opinion, freedom of expression, freedom of association and economic freedom.
183	We have a proposal that elevates homosexuality to the same position as holy marriage.
184	We are thereby boosting the positions of the European Union regarding the practical situations experienced by European nationals in connection with discrimination and equal treatment.
185	I too would like to touch on the issue of exception made for religious organisations.
186	Concerns have been raised with me about the potential interpretation of the explanatory notes to Article 1, which again may seem a bit obscure, but these distinguish between sexual orientation and behaviour.
187	This is the hierarchy of discrimination.
188	So New Caledonia operates a preference based on skin colour.
189	These aspects of the directive, together with the fact that, a short time ago, Directive 2000 was adopted, are proof of the avowed will of the European Union to guarantee an open society, free from predetermined categorisations and, most importantly, from the stigma of racism, which has its roots deep in European history.
190	So those who claim here that Europe does not need to lay down in a directive the values which we all aim to defend are mistaken.
191	Do not meddle with these hard-won gains.
192	Finally, ladies and gentlemen, the media must also play an important role in this task.
193	Experience has also shown us that the promotion of anti-discrimination legislation is essential but it is not enough.
194	We must avoid absurd tangles of red tape, which will only succeed in reducing Europe to a purely materialistic, politically correct but pointless entity.
195	In my view, Parliament has overdone it when it comes to the rather restrained legislation which the European Commission would have wanted to submit.
196	I want to begin by thanking both rapporteurs, Mr Mann and Mr Cashman, for their quite excellent reports.
197	I will also accept the amendments you have tabled to bring out the importance of preventing discrimination, as well as combating it.
198	The second category aims to clarify the text of the Commission proposal and the third category consists of a large number of amendments which try to bring this proposal in line with the directive on racial discrimination adopted last June.
199	In particular, Amendments Nos 9, 10 and 20 propose the removal of the reference to discrimination based on racial and ethnic origin.
200	I cannot accept your references in Amendments Nos 21 and 45 to natural and legal persons and non-formalised groups of persons, as this employment proposal only applies to individuals.
201	The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon.
202	You cannot expect public support for peacemaking operations if our troops face death from weapons which we have ourselves supplied.
203	In my own country I would need a licence to own a shotgun but not to set up as an arms broker in my garden shed.
204	Another major point is the ban on exporting, promoting and selling equipment and expertise which is, in practice, to be used for the purposes of torture.
205	Having said this, I would naturally like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Titley on his excellent report.
206	We must extend our study, on the one hand, not only to matters of binding agreements, but also to instruments other than those intended specifically for military purposes, voluntary disarmament, conversion, and making the work of the police and customs authorities more effective, and, on the other hand, the applicant countries just mentioned by Mr Wiersma.
207	Monitoring the money circuit is bound to make it more difficult to avoid arms trade regulations.
208	The aim of the annual review is to identify such potential improvements.
209	The European Union is currently considering the continuation of the project beyond its expiry date in November of this year.
210	A methodology and indicators have been defined and will be presented at the next Research Council.
211	Thank you, Commissioner.
212	As regards the issue of SMEs, we have, of course, been careful to ensure that SMEs play a part in the framework programme, as was stipulated in the budget decision.
213	At least that is what seems to be coming out of the budget debate in Greece, and many people are calling upon the European Union to make its views clear.
214	I share your views on multidisciplinarity.
215	The first is that he specifically mentioned in his statement EU participation in national programmes.
216	There can therefore be no talk of a European Research Area if we are only responsible for 5% of that research.
217	Thank you very much, Mr Busquin.
218	On the one hand, as a result of the efforts made to commit all the appropriations at the end of 1999, there was inevitably a very sharp drop in applications for the financing of new projects at the beginning of this financial year.
219	I would, however, reiterate that Portugal did indeed handle matters well in the previous period.
220	Question No 2 by (H-0730/00):
221	Finally, if duties on mineral oils are laid down at a high level, this does not lead to non-compliance with Community regulations in terms of competition.
222	Secondly, as Mr MacCormick knows, where Member States favour by fiscal means a certain sector of industry, they thereby infringe the rules on state aid, in this case fiscal state aid which is akin to a subsidy.
223	For example, nuclear energy is a very clear case in point.
224	Subject: Budget line for minority languages The budget line of the European Union for minority languages was introduced in 1983 and increased steadily to reach a peak in 1995 with EUR 4 million.
225	Mr President, I am sure my parliamentary colleagues know that the Structural Funds - and this is something new - earmark very substantial funds for cultural activities, for both I and Michel Barnier considered it important to ensure that the Structural Funds do not invest only in roads and airports but also in people.
226	Thus the Commission will not make new financing commitments next year.
227	Where concrete financing proposals are concerned, it is not possible for me to adopt a position here, because we must respect the normal procedures.
228	I have thought of a number of different possibilities.
229	This must be addressed, as we are talking of millions of SMEs throughout Europe.
230	Do the requirements relating to hunting, for example of elk, also cover the treatment of meat for own consumption?
231	If these rules were to be applied to meat consumed by people within their own households, this would constitute a bureaucratic disaster for elk hunting.
232	When this report has been concluded, I intend to present proposals to improve the transport of animals and the problem of insufficient enforcement of the travelling time limits will be addressed.
233	We discussed this issue previously at my meeting with the Green Group.
234	Our question was clear: what measures is the Commission taking?
235	The general product safety also puts an obligation on producers to provide consumers with information on risks.
236	Maryam Ayubi's case is extremely disturbing.
237	Question No 14 by (H-0745/00):
238	The EU's attitude towards that ministerial meeting in Vientiane and indeed, whether it should take place at all, or at what level the EU should be represented at it, will depend on developments in Burma between now and December.
239	One last point.
240	The elections are an important step in involving the people of Kosovo in the running of their own communities.
241	I can tell you that these elections were conducted democratically, and were better than elections in our own countries, which I have happened to take part in or observe on many occasions.
242	But we saw it as a beginning and not by any means the end of the process.
243	It argues in favour of better and stricter controls in the arms trade and greater transparency.
244	Now I find that contracts for arms and components for arms are increasing every year.
245	We cannot take practical decisions based on false information and distorted realities.
246	The arrangement whereby they have been kept together within the same DG should be reviewed.
247	While these institutions must have the option of appointing an internal auditor, it is sufficient to impose certain minimum audit requirements on the financial controller.
248	This proposal does not meet with unanimous approval in this Parliament as, the Commissioner well knows.
249	So - nothing against an independent, internal audit service, to which we are giving the green light today with Mr van Hulten' s report!
250	Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur.
251	We believe it is urgently necessary to modernise the management.
252	Independent counter-checks are essential in order to avoid errors.
253	In future the money is to be spent in a more targeted and effective manner, and of course we also want a better guarantee that the funds are actually spent for the purposes decided by the budgetary authority.
254	Turning now to the proposed amendments, let me say briefly that the Commission approves the insertion of the extra recital.
255	Let me therefore thank you for your proposals and your opinions.
256	I would like to summarise the proposals made in this report which I feel are most important and most viable in practical terms: firstly, the setting up of an group of experts consisting of high-level individuals appointed by the Member States to contribute to the definition of common criteria for the protection of minors in the media context; secondly, the establishment by all the operators in the sector of a code of self-regulation in respect of the protection of minors; thirdly, the possibility of promoting filtering systems and making them available for use on both television programmes and the Internet.
257	Unfortunately, I cannot endorse the Liberals' demands.
258	That is and remains mainly the task of Member State legislation, although it certainly does not preclude a consensual agreement on certain basic values in a dialogue with all concerned at European level.
259	But, all other things being equal, I think it is the job of parents to prevent their children from seeing that sort of thing at home.
260	Parents are in particular need of help here, and in the following form: parameters to protect minors in the media context throughout the European Union, the introduction of filter systems available at low cost, legislation to protect minors and assumption of responsibility by the media, enterprises and private and public-sector providers.
261	So when I hear some people stating in debates in committee that there is nothing to prove that television violence in all its forms may have a harmful influence upon children, I am, to put it mildly, surprised.
262	With regard to the introduction of a self-regulation code, it should be noted, particularly in terms of the technical aspects, that, in a number of Member States, broadcasters have already introduced coding systems for television sets to enable parents to cut off the power.
263	The debate is closed.
264	Specifically my report replaces the worthy international generalisations by, in effect, repatriating the decisions to the Member States.
265	This is the very minimum necessary if we are to achieve that area of freedom which is the basic right of every European citizen.
266	Some outstanding payments date back as far as 1996.
267	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Mr Evans and Mr Mantovani for their work.
268	I would commend this report to the House and recommend support for the amendments put forward by Mr Evans.
269	Our human resources are our only future in a world in which there is no more valuable commodity than knowledge.
270	It is through practical action and not through green or white papers or, for that matter, black or red ones, that problems are solved.
271	However, as is its proper role, Parliament has exerted pressure for researchers to be included in the text nonetheless.
272	Your visit today comes at what is a crucial time for European integration.
273	Yet, as we know, the process is incomplete and, as such, it is not firing on all four cylinders.
274	If we do not make this clear now, in this sensitive, turbulent passage of European and world history, when will we be able to?
275	None of us can claim to know, here and now, exactly when and in what order we will achieve these goals, but we do all know that, if we firmly believe in and desire these things, then we will already be halfway to success.
276	We must make sure women benefit from the new jobs generated, while avoiding reproducing the inequalities that exist in more traditional sectors: less skilled jobs, part-time work (sometimes not by choice), insecure contracts and difficulties put in the way of access to decision-making posts.
277	A proposal on indicators to measure progress will be put before the Council.
278	Finally, in a word, the fourth pillar devoted to equal opportunities reinforces the integrated approach to equality through gender mainstreaming and through specific guidelines.
279	I am thinking in particular of the violence they suffer, one of my priorities for government action, and I know that is a specific issue that impels you to action too.
280	We know that measures for combining family and working life particularly favour women, although research is still needed into the current situation of the family and the role that women play in it, which is no longer the traditional role, because society has changed a great deal, and at the same time, so has family structure.
281	Sometimes, some people - even colleagues in this Assembly - seem to believe that they do have equal opportunities, but they do not.
282	I should like to conclude by saying that equality begins in the home.
283	I find that position awkward and ambiguous, and I think that means more thought is required on the drafts you are presenting to us, because there is no certainty that all this will produce practical results.
284	In that area, there is no equality.
285	The image of the European woman we find in the pages of our reports and directives does not correspond to that of these Danish women, the majority of whom are saying no to the euro.
286	I therefore find it telling that the report is seeking to establish a numerical balance between men and women across all sectors of society, for example in the labour market.
287	This is exactly why keeping marriage and family completely out of the picture in this report represents a lost opportunity.
288	The Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities would also do well to take this advice to heart.
289	We have heard that the previous Council Presidency first restructured and then scrapped the Ministry for Equality.
290	Women' s average salaries are still lower than men' s, by around 28% on average, which is a contributory factor to women making up the bulk of the poor and to preventing them from participating in social and political life.
291	That is really excellent.
292	Today we are witnessing the pauperisation of wage-earning women all over Europe, including France, where 15% of them live on less than FRF 3 650 a month.
293	Not all countries have managed to follow France' s example, which I hope will bear fruit elsewhere.
294	Of course the history of feminism is very long.
295	The candidates really must be helped to come up to the level of the acquis communautaire.
296	However, I need your help here.
297	That is not the case, but it is a satisfactory text and, having given it great thought and following an extensive debate, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market decided not to table any amendments.
298	The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, following a long debate, considered that it was not reasonable to maintain legal uncertainty for a period of six years, and that three years, which is the period set, is a more reasonable period of time for establishing, with the appropriate means and the average proceedings, whether or not there were irregularities in a declaration.
299	It is Amendment No 15, on fraud.
300	The goal to achieve simplified yet quality communication whilst building in a sufficient level of flexibility with regard to the basic rules, thus improving the procedure for collecting duties and offering a higher degree of adjustment of the provisions with regard to offering goods at customs, meets one of the requirements of the single market, and that has been achieved in this case, so much so, in fact, that many countries have drawn on this model in order to speed up the process to be able to take part in international trade.
301	It would like to thank Parliament and the committee chaired by Mrs Palacio, in particular, for the efforts made and interest shown by Parliament and the committee with regard to this dossier.
302	Welcome
303	I trust this will not change the way we vote, but the French translation really must be checked.
304	Mr President, I voted in favour of the Evans report.
305	Knowledge of foreign languages is accepted as a necessary precursor to mobility.
306	We also believe that, to a great extent, the Member States themselves should be allowed to decide on the taxes to be collected.
307	I was slightly disappointed that we did not have the opportunity to get majority support for the need to set a limit on the storage of documents.
308	During the Treaty of Amsterdam negotiations we were delighted with the inclusion of Article 13 on discrimination on the grounds of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age and sexual orientation.
309	My final comment relates to the budget for this programme, EUR 98.4 million. That figure is obviously inadequate given the actions envisaged.
310	It is manifestly clear from the justification for the amendment that the purpose is also to interfere in provisions on age that apply in Member States, which, in any case, are fully justified for reasons of psychological development, and they do not have any kind of impact in the job market.
311	I also think that we can do without the entire contents of the new Article 12 (a).
312	On religion/belief, the EPLP welcomes the principle of protection on these grounds.
313	Broadly speaking, the Christian Democrats welcome the proposal for a directive establishing a general framework for employment equality.
314	But this only says something about the staffing levels of the internal audit department and nothing about the financial significance and hence usefulness of such a department.
315	The EU has decided to develop a joint military capacity in order to fulfil the so-called Petersberg objectives (crisis management and conflict resolution outside the territory of the EU), but it has no common defence policy.
316	The world would be a safer place without weapons.
317	The resolution is not seeking to reduce arms sales radically to promote a policy of disarmament, but just to regulate them in order to guarantee greater profits for the industrial groups.
318	The Commission communication acknowledges the problem but proposes no specific measures because it is blinkered by the philosophy of market liberalisation and competition, and any proposals which it makes fail to get to the heart of the harsh reality - a reality especially harsh on children - of the unaccountability of multinationals which, in their lust for profit, are indifferent to the impact which their programmes and products have and which not only shift the entire responsibility to parents but even expect them to buy new products to protect their children.
319	Like the rapporteur, I believe measures intended to protect young people from violent and harmful programmes should not be limited to traditional television but should apply to all media.
320	With viewing averaging three hours per day, it is the most extensive human activity after sleep and - for adults - work.
321	Moreover, women are often in 'flexible' jobs; temporary contracts and low salaries are typical in sectors where women employees are in a majority.
322	They are the first to fall foul of cuts in public spending, privatisation of the health sector, the right to health care and medical attention - never mind the right to prevention and information programmes.
323	B5-0792/2000, by Mr Marset Campos and Mr Di Lello Finuoli, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the crisis in Peru.
324	Mr President, I would prefer it if, for once, we could have a debate on Latin America following well-prepared discussions in the committees, rather than it being part of some urgent procedure or other.
325	We must ensure that, when Peru reaches its goal, it has candidates who are capable of rising to the challenge and responding to the Peruvian people's demand for political renewal and genuine democracy.
326	The joint debate is closed.
327	We know Afghanistan is not far away, and we know it is the world' s largest producer of opiates, so we can well imagine the role played by these political mafias, which are not necessarily simply political, in the expansion of the drug trade.
328	It calls on the Commission to take stock of the humanitarian aid measures intended for the Afghan population so that this aid reaches everyone.
329	Terrible suffering has been caused by this conflict.
330	There has been a budget heading for the funding of mine clearance and prevention programmes for many years now.
331	I would like to take the opportunity to say, in response to Mrs Paciotti' s comment, that naturally I will not hesitate to inquire within the Commission today as to what has become of the funding for mine clearance and what is going to become of it.
332	B5-0794/2000, by Mr Medina Ortega, Mr Linkohr and Mr Fava, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the kidnap in Colombia of a Spanish Jesuit engaged in negotiations with the guerillas;
333	Unfortunately, we all hoped that we would not have to discuss Colombia again.
334	The Commission has already offered to coordinate the measures for a package of this kind, and is planning to approve a considerable amount of funding for this package as early as in the next few days.
335	So, once again, we have double standards and I think that is deplorable.
336	I am particularly at a loss to understand the behaviour of the Albanian opposition party, which has deliberately closed its mind to the necessary solution to the Albanian problem in Macedonia.
337	In my view, it is an extraordinary achievement on the part of the Macedonians to be able to settle the issue within their own borders.
338	Therefore, I also believe that this reconciliation is sustainable, but that the government, which has very courageously found a solution to the university issue and to many other issues, needs visible signs of its success, and powerful support, else peace throughout the region will be under threat.
339	The PHARE funding made available for the year 2000 under the national programme could also be used to support the university in the coming academic year, i.e. in 2001 and 2002.
340	I should like to point out that all the Greek MEPs have now reacted against this situation.
341	And because all this concerns Greece, which has the biggest shipping sector in the European Union, it basically concerns the safety of all types of shipping throughout the Union.
342	In recent years many other lives have been lost at sea in our waters, not only by way of major ferry disasters but, on all too frequent a basis, from amongst our fishing communities.
343	On the contrary, innocent victims are being exploited in order to promote shipowners' wider objectives.
344	We must be aware that when something like this happens, the credibility of the European Union also comes into play.
345	Finally, I should like to stress that the Commission is convinced of the need to make European legislation on the safety of passenger ferries a top priority and to ensure that this legislation is applied strictly and uniformly throughout the Community.
346	Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, excuse me for having arrived a little late, for reasons that you are well aware of, in order to make a brief declaration on the two matters on the agenda: the situation in Belgrade and in the former Republic of Yugoslavia in general, and the situation in the Middle East.
347	Like Mr Solana, Commissioner Verheugen will be speaking on the two issues on our agenda this afternoon, which is to say the Middle East and the elections in Yugoslavia.
348	We must be prepared to keep this promise as soon as the will of the people is respected.
349	Madam President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, I take part in this debate with certain reservations because I do not want this Parliament giving the impression that it is sitting in judgment, casting anathema on this or that person when, after such great hopes were raised here only a month ago, we face the dramatic consequences of this new explosion of violence in the Middle East.
350	Madam President, my contribution today is not based on all kinds of theoretical analyses but on my own experiences over the past week, because I happened to be in Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip when the disturbances took place.
351	While condemning all forms of violence, we cannot make any parallel between the Israeli violence and the Palestinian violence.
352	I would like to ask Parliament at this critical hour to issue a statement of support for the brave people who have, today, defended freedom and liberty in the streets of Belgrade, echoing the support which we Europeans gave not many years ago to sustain those people in other capitals who were also fighting for their freedom.
353	Madam President, there is no doubt that Europe would be well advised to seize the opportunity presented to us here by the Chairman of the Palestinian Legislative Council.
354	The position of Jerusalem is a moot point in the negotiations.
355	He has managed for years, with the help of his propaganda machine and by exerting brutal pressure on the media, to deceive the people in his own country and, unfortunately, many in the western world, to whom he has misrepresented the real situation.
356	As the drama concludes it is the duty of this Parliament, as a symbol of united free Europe, to support the crowds outside the Yugoslav parliament and to help Mr Kostunica to achieve and fulfil the mandate.
357	Precisely this unfeeling attitude is also making us fear the worst - and current events are bearing out the words written by myself only a few hours ago.
358	I wonder if the Commissioner has planned any steps in this respect to demonstrate that we really do consider Kostunica to be the only lawfully elected representative of the Serbian people, and the only partner with whom the European Union is involved as from today.
359	The European Parliament wishes to express its total solidarity with them at this historic time, as tyranny crumbles and democracy emerges triumphant.
360	The next item is the report (A5-0237/2000) by Mr SeppÃ¤nen, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a Council Decision amending Decision 2000/24/EC so as to extend the Community guarantee granted to the European Investment Bank to cover loans for projects in Croatia (COM(2000) 289 - C5-0336/2000 - 2000/0122(CNS)).
361	We must welcome the new political direction that is being taken there, following the legislative and presidential elections.
362	Between the Union and Croatia there is an advisory working party in place, whose purpose it is to offer Croatia expertise and technical assistance in negotiations on contractual relations.
363	Let us not forget that, until recently, Croatia was the classic example of a privatisation programme which had got completely out of hand, and which benefited only one individual.
364	The contribution under discussion, which would take the form of an EIB loan in excess of EUR 250 million for the period from 2000 to 2007, may not prove to be a milestone, but it would certainly help the process on its way.
365	It is therefore not quite accurate for the report to talk in terms of democratisation.
366	When half a century ago, Croatia and Slovakia became nominally independent for the first time, they became vassals of the Hitler regime.
367	Of course we cannot consider the issue of guarantee payments and the issue of Croatia separately from the debate that took place yesterday evening and the developments in Belgrade.
368	When it appears that Milosevic has fled and the will of the people has prevailed, we hope that action to establish normal relations and partnership between Serbia and this Union of democracies will only be days away.
369	I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday 6 October 2000.
370	(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)
371	My question is: Who is speaking for the European Parliament concerning this Statute?
372	I ask you, Madam President, to do everything possible to speed up the procedure under way in the Committee on Petitions concerning a protest document that has been presented by more than thirty social groups and NGOs against this situation, in which there has been a blatant failure to comply with Community regulations on radiation protection.
373	The autopsy performed in Georgia revealed that he was the victim of murder and had, in all probability, been tortured.
374	Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have the opportunity to take a great step towards your dream, one I do not, however, personally share.
375	This is the fundamental piece of legislation and it forms the basis for any other piece of legislation governing genetically modified plants.
376	He is obviously making a habit of putting his foot in it.
377	(The sitting was suspended at 5.40 p.m. and resumed at 5.50 p.m.)
378	The next item is the report (A5-0291/2000) by Mrs Van Lancker, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission communication to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the social policy agenda [COM(2000) 379 - C5-0508/2000 - 2000/2219(COS)].
379	Stressing the importance of this open coordination method does not mean that this method should replace social legislation, because we should lay down social rights in Europe too. We should have the nerve to formulate minimum social standards and draft social legislation which is necessary within the framework of a European internal market.
380	In our opinion we also support dialogue and cooperation with civil society, especially women' s organisations in countries preparing to join the European family, because here too we must anticipate uniform development which follows in the footsteps and adopts the rationale of the rest of Europe.
381	The areas of action listed in the Commission communication were also subject to general agreement.
382	Let me, at this point, remind you that there will be a European Seminar on this subject on 4 and 5 December in Biarritz, which I shall be chairing.
383	At the Employment and Social Policy Council held on 17 October, a great deal of progress was made in the fight against exclusion by defining appropriate objectives for the fight against poverty and social exclusion, which will serve as a foundation for national action plans.
384	I have heard from some quarters that having read the report, they agree with the diagnosis but not with the prescription.
385	Technological development and new methods of organisation call, of course, for flexible cooperation in which we concentrate more on objectives and on achieving results and less upon rigid regulation.
386	It is in this area that we can, in our opinion, find the kind of old-fashioned ideas attributed to those who expect a brave new world to spring out of a free market.
387	This has certainly helped to reduce industrial unrest in our country and has contributed to increased inward investment programmes from abroad.
388	The method used, on the other hand, seems more debatable.
389	In discussing a Charter of Fundamental Rights and advocating a European Constitution we cannot shy away from certain issues: we have to insist that all the necessary measures must be taken, even if this means producing more accurate legislation.
390	I would like to raise a criticism in connection with the lack of initiatives produced in response to the new challenges we face in health and safety at work, employee participation and labour relations.
391	Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, the Commissioner and Mrs PÃ©ry on this presentation of the social agenda.
392	These are points which, we know, are contested by the conservatives in Europe, but to which we, in our Group, attach great importance.
393	The third strand in the content is enlargement.
394	The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m.
395	The Commission' s proposed measures should be expanded to include reviews of individual access to medical and health care and to social security and pensions, an analysis of shortcomings in the organisation of work and perhaps also a study of the significance of a general reduction in working hours.
396	Women will then feel close to Europe and Europe will benefit from the interesting and innovative ideas which will be formulated as a result of their connections with this programme.
397	We expect to receive an annual report from the President of the Commission, within the context of an annual debate in the European Parliament.
398	I am delighted, moreover, that improvements in childcare facilities are planned in order to better support the reconciliation of professional and family life.
399	This is something my Group will take into consideration in its final vote.
400	(The President cut the speaker off)
401	I find the Commission' s new approach to be a very positive one, and the proposal for a decision for the 2001-2005 programme to have been well considered.
402	I think that the large number of amendments accepted is illustrative of the meeting of minds between the Commission and the Committee on Women' s Rights.
403	Firstly because, in the course of last year, I was approached on a number of occasions by companies which have felt a certain degree of powerlessness in connection with rulings on mergers, especially in relation to those cases in which they have needed to appeal to the Court of First Instance against the Commission' s ruling.
404	I also want to take the opportunity to ask Commissioner Monti if and when a public, efficient and properly functioning register of State aid may be expected to be put in place and, in the same vein, when the long-promised scoreboard is to become a reality.
405	I would also make the point to Commissioner Monti that it is important that in the next survey we see a rather larger section on the financial services sector.
406	This does not just apply to the sphere of energy policy; it applies right across the board.
407	Commissioner Monti, on behalf of the Italian Radicals, I too would like to thank the rapporteurs for the two sound reports they have produced, which commend both your work and the work of the Directorate-General for Competition.
408	I stress this point because the market cannot regulate everything, which is why competition is not completely unrestricted, nor should it be.
409	Mr President, today no one disputes, and of course I am not going to do so, the fact that state aid alters the conditions for competition and is a damaging element that encourages inefficiency in undertakings.
410	Hearing him deny the fact that state aid was reduced in the period 1994-1998, even though the Commission itself acknowledges this reduction, is already bizarre, to say the least.
411	And obviously, Mr President, although my opinion refers to the Commission' s 29th report on competition policy, it is inevitable at such a time that we will look to the past, but for no other reason than in order to learn for the future.
412	Mr President, in the time available to me, I would like to focus on the following three points: the modernisation of Community competition law, the practical application of competition rules in 1999 and State aid.
413	The Commission has continued to intervene resolutely, particularly where cartels and abuse of a dominating position are concerned.
414	Mr Rapkay, it has been extremely important for the Commission to have the support of the European Parliament in pursuit of its competition policy and I do not feel that this support may fade away.
415	This mechanism can be activated either at the request of a Member State or under Article 119 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, a provision which remains in force during the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union for the States which are covered by a derogation, currently Denmark, the United Kingdom and Sweden.
416	In future, recourse to the capital market should be the only option available.
417	I would therefore urge the House to assent to the report as it stands, and hope that this will enable the European internal market to be brought into play for vine propagating material.
418	It now needs to be revised to take into account developments in phytosanitary regulations and scientific and technical progress, particularly in the field of in vitro propagation.
419	I also feel that, abiding by this precautionary principle, referring to the possibility of genetic modification, means, for example, cutting down on the intensive use of phytosanitary treatments.
420	In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, in order to respect the precautionary principle in both spirit and letter, should the articles and amendments which I have just mentioned not be withdrawn, then, as the wine growers themselves demand, we would have to fall in with the opinion of Marianne Isler BÃ©guin, and the Committee on the Environment, and vote against them.
421	Mr President, if you permit, I should like to ask the Commissioner to give an opinion on the amendment put forward by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, Amendment No 1.
422	The only issue open to debate is whether or not I should have taken note of the decree terminating Mr Le Pen' s mandate as soon as the French government notified me of it.
423	I would remind you that the vote is to take place at 12.30.
424	In the field of justice and home affairs, I am optimistic that a solution will be found concerning judicial cooperation in civil cases.
425	The preparatory group is to play a full role up until 19 November, the date of the next ministerial level meeting.
426	We needed this invigorating climate, as Mr Moscovici has said, and I too sensed among the Heads of State and of Government a very solemn air of collective and historic responsibility at this historic juncture for European integration.
427	Ladies and gentlemen, we must quite simply see to it that from now on we keep alive the spirit and climate of Biarritz as regards these qualified majority voting issues.
428	The small countries are not there to take orders from the large countries of the European Union.
429	I would be grateful if the President-in-Office of the Council could clarify this point.
430	On the one hand, the presence of President Kostunica was an historic event.
431	Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, while progress has been made on closer cooperation and the extension of qualified majority voting, deep-seated disagreement persists, as you yourself have underlined, concerning the composition of the Commission and the weighting of votes in Council.
432	It seems to me that we are moving in the opposite direction.
433	Those who stand apart from reinforced cooperation are really being given the same freedom as the back seat passengers in a car.
434	I am no more qualified than you to meddle in German internal affairs, but feel that this position is extremely consistent and if I am not mistaken also moves into line with what the Commission wants.
435	We have started to exchange ideas on this question, from which it has emerged that all the Member States want to maintain this ceiling after enlargement.
436	I do not think it will happen.
437	Firstly, one sometimes had the impression that at Biarritz there was an obsession with the debate between the smaller and the larger states.
438	On this count, I consider it insufficient to say that the Community method must be safeguarded.
439	Even once the present candidate countries have joined, each Member State must be able to retain one junior or senior Commissioner.
440	The wording of Article 93 becomes all the more critical considering that, once the first wave of new states has joined the Union, it will be all the more difficult for us to progress towards qualified majority voting.
441	One has to convince the citizens in these countries of the clear merits of any new European treaty.
442	We would be failing to understand the origins of this crisis if we imagined that fears which have reigned for generations were to give way to lasting peace, a prelude to reconciliation, without further ado.
443	I am also worried by the minimum response to Parliament' s call for democratisation.
444	It is, rather, those who are demanding extensive reforms prior to enlargement who are guilty of that.
445	On the one hand, there is the decision by the head of the Israeli government to put the peace negotiations on hold due to the violence in the area and focus on the creation of a government of national unity with the head of the opposition, Mr Sharon.
446	Needless to say, we in this Parliament can only rejoice at the victory of the Yugoslav people and the election of Mr Kostunica as President.
447	I would advise Mr BarÃ³n Crespo to ask his Italian colleagues to explain to him why they are in government in Italy with an openly Communist party and why they are preparing to go to the political elections with another openly Communist party, the Communist Refoundation Party.
448	This is precisely where we must advance the cause of the codecision procedure.
449	The Commission, having the option of simple majority voting, would be better equipped to provide this impetus in the future.
450	The Union does not now need visionaries with tunnel vision leading up to the year 2030, but problem-solvers that can see the problems that enlargement over the next 3 to 8 years will bring with it, and see the solutions to them.
451	We are thus talking about an open piece of work which has not fallen from on high or been imposed from above.
452	That concludes the debate.
453	Without this fundamental point of reference, at best there is mutual lack of understanding and at worst there is mutual killing.
454	Democracy in Europe is in good health, but European democracy is in a bad way.
455	Today, the 24 October 2000, in Strasbourg, the European Parliament is stating one simple message loudly and clearly: the European Constitution is something you can achieve and something that we indeed want.
456	It expresses the idea, that is, that island status is in itself an adequate criterion.
457	Let me go to the heart of the matter, focussing on the salient points of Mr Gil-Robles' report, which I shall simply describe as excellent in my view.
458	Firstly, simplification and clarification of the Treaties.
459	I shall not continue, as we are not here, or I, at least, am not here, to discuss the Institute' s report.
460	According to the information available to the Presidency, forgive me if I have to be technical at this point, it appears that the clear majority of the language versions, unlike the Italian version, as far as the implementation of cohesion policy is concerned, refer only to the less favoured islands and not to islands in general.
461	Mr Duhamel, you will undoubtedly agree with me that if Nice is not successful, there will be no room, or at least no credibility, for consideration of the future of European integration, at least within the current framework.
462	What this European constitution will also need to do is clearly establish the distribution of tasks between the Member States and the European Union, inject the dynamism of European integration into those areas where it is badly needed, and provide for joint action to be taken, for example in the sphere of foreign and security policy.
463	It may also prove essential if we are to overcome persistent obstacles.
464	A clearer distribution of powers is required, as well as a clearer definition of the subsidiarity principle.
465	As is well known, opinion on this differs widely in the various Member States and amongst the various forces of society.
466	Unfortunately, the ultimate objective of a European Constitution would be precisely the opposite, and so, of course, we cannot vote for it.
467	In the enhanced European house, some nations will be sitting at the military, monetary, and possibly tax, tables, and others will be left out.
468	Obviously the second version is incorrect, first because regions lagging behind economically are, in any case, covered by the Structural Funds and, secondly, because if this interpretation were correct, there would have been no point in adopting declaration No 30.
469	Mr President, I shall focus my scant sixty seconds on the report by Mr Duhamel, which is a good report, because it has the courage to state things clearly and the eloquence of our rapporteur just now has finally convinced us.
470	In my view, the unity of Europe cannot but be political.
471	In our opinion, the new Constitution should even be ready to enter into force by the next European elections.
472	Consequently, the description "less developed" is applied to the island regions as well as to the other regions and, according to Mr Barnier' s proposal, what is required here is the amendment of the Italian text of the Treaty, in accordance with the provisions of the Vienna Convention.
473	The debate is closed.
474	Since the honourable Member said she would vote against, this amendment is repealed.
475	Mr President, what is being asked for here is a recipe for chaos.
476	I welcome the EP' s adoption of the Trakatellis report as it provides for the setting of high standards of quality and safety of blood and blood derivatives.
477	If European parliamentary immunity is independent, the French authorities ought to have consulted us regarding the waiver of Mr Le Pen' s immunity.
478	I am particularly disappointed at the European Parliament' s vote on the report on the reproduction of vine plants.
479	To some, alcohol, like tobacco and drugs, is a product which can cause a great deal of harm to the users and the people around them; to others, it is mainly a source of employment which can generate large sums of money.
480	The rapporteur generally welcomes the proposals in the Commission White Paper on this subject but is apprehensive of the possible implications of the reform, which aims principally to decentralise the implementation of competition rules.
481	During the debate yesterday evening, I welcomed the work of Mr Evans, but I was immediately bound to express my deep disagreement with the rather too liberal, not to say ultraliberal, tenor of his report.
482	IDA Ireland has been reorganising that focus so as to win half of all new jobs from Greenfield Projects in the Objective 1 region over the coming three years.
483	Sometimes, when the consequences of this policy cause an outcry, state intervention, aid and other economic and fiscal incentives come along and go some way to restoring the situation.
484	(The sitting was suspended at 2.06 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
485	So here we are in October 2000, with only a short while to go before the financial framework for Budget 2001 is agreed.
486	But that did not stop the Council from cutting agricultural expenditure by a total of EUR 555 million.
487	In addition, naturally we take the view that it would not be acceptable simply to create 400 additional jobs, i.e. on top of those already in existence.
488	All I can say to the Council is: follow our example.
489	Hence the administration of this House is there to serve the delegates, and not vice versa.
490	The European Court of Auditors is giving us the least cause for concern at present.
491	Finally, we also handle the Ombudsman' s budget.
492	On the contrary, we feel that there should be increased efforts in research, particularly in view of the candidate countries.
493	Furthermore, we propose that Parliament should be kept informed on a regular basis.
494	When a legislative conciliation takes place on social, cultural or environmental issues - and the Commissioner will recognise that I am right - the Commissioner for Budgets, the Ministers for Finance and the members of the Committee on Budgets all pray that a financial blunder will not occur.
495	Mr President, honourable Members, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your welcome.
496	The Council voted through, at the first reading, the appropriations that it felt to be justified for 2001, without taking into consideration any tactical concerns would only work against the objective of the sound allocation of appropriations, which is the objective that the Community institutions must pursue.
497	Before you reach your decision on this draft budget, I would like to emphasise that the Council and Parliament share a number of objectives on which agreement could well be reached by our two arms of the budgetary authority.
498	We are in a similar situation as regards structural policy.
499	The conciliation process which took place in the summer - Mr Colom i Naval made this point - had a positive outcome too, in that, in future, there will be an increase in the information made available to Parliament, and all new legislative proposals must be accompanied by an estimate of their compatibility with the financial forecasts.
500	I would remind you that the financial plan for the Balkans agreed last year only made provision for EUR 1.85 billion for the entire period up to 2006.
501	I would again urge you - the Commission is leaving your proposal on the table - to examine this proposal without bias and consider it as a possibility.
502	The material was obviously useful for both the preparation of the 2001 budget and for the 1999 discharge.
503	As much as I, as a member of the Committee on Budgets, appreciate the work undertaken by this committee, and as impressed as I am by the labours of the Committee on Budgets' rapporteurs, as rapporteur for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, it is imperative that I highlight two proposed amendments, which the committee is resubmitting to the plenary, and which are by no means insignificant, despite the small amounts involved.
504	In implementing these measures, we aim to get legal supervision back into full working order, restore people' s faith in the legal certainty of the EU, and strengthen the European Union as a Community of law.
505	The Commission' s attempt to abolish this initiative showed out-and-out disregard for the political will of Lisbon and the priorities of this House.
506	This was an astonishing decision and left many of us feeling that this whole very important programme had simply become a football in a game between the Budgets Committee and the Commission.
507	The third point pertains to European agricultural policy as it is now before us in the budget proposals.
508	Whilst employment may be the European Union' s priority policy, fisheries, as another economic sector, cannot remain on the sidelines.
509	I am especially glad that we have been able to safeguard financing for the Socrates, Youth and Culture 2000 programmes that were decided at the end of last year.
510	For example, with regard to our aid to Mediterranean countries, we have a backlog which has accumulated over many years of budgets.
511	Mr President, in previous years' debates I spoke for the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, where we heard from Mrs Iivari this afternoon.
512	But I would like to say to Parliament this afternoon that we should not lose sight of the fact that the EU spends just 1% of GDP and much of that is administered in the Member States.
513	Let me turn to the overall strategy.
514	This brings me to our group' s strategy, because at the core of our belief is the wish to get value for money for the European citizen.
515	On the contrary, we must work for a Parliament which campaigns for openness, efficiency and effective democratic control of the European institutions.
516	And so we must think about how to solve this problem.
517	We want to drive democratisation processes forward, and we want to strike a balance between the traditional political fields of foreign policy now before us.
518	The most difficult problems in the new budget concern external action.
519	Naturally there is a need to budget carefully, we support this and should not try to get round it.
520	This is a truly extraordinary initiative, especially at first reading, and one that is bound to be unsuccessful, for in the present circumstances it cannot possible gain a majority of votes in favour.
521	That being the case, the level of funding allocated to Kosovo is not without certain problems.
522	Budget policy needs to instil public confidence in European policy.
523	We must therefore support all the measures designed to boost small and medium-sized enterprises.
524	the level of budgetary implementation;
525	By preserving this strategic approach in the way we address the budget this year and in years to come, the European Parliament will fully play its role in the budgetary process.
526	With the transfer of EUR 175 million we have estimated EUR 25 million more than we expected.
527	As regards MEDA, the Council said that the commitments are not a problem owing to the eight years of payment backlogs.
528	I believe that Mr Duff was present this morning when we discussed the European Council in Biarritz.
529	My answer is very simple.
530	Ramiro Zapata was the latest of 25 human rights activists to be murdered and, recently, the Colombian press condemned the paramilitary groups' "Plan 100" to kill one hundred human rights activists.
531	I am a bit happier with the attitude of the Council today than I was in July because, as on many occasions in situations of crisis, the European Union seems always to be the last authority to arrive on the international scene and make its voice heard.
532	The question, Mr President, and I shall end here, is whether there is a solution that would exert greater pressure than that proposed by the President in his statement and whether the aid we are going to give will be entirely different from that of the United States, in other words, not intended for crop-spraying, but for crop replacement and also for social, rather than military, purposes.
533	The questions that I and other Members asked are very specifically related to the situation in Colombia.
534	As they deal with the same subject, Question Nos 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 will be taken together.
535	Subject: Tax on financial transactions In recent months there have been growing calls for a tax on financial speculation, with ATTAC committees (association for a tax on financial transactions and aid for citizens) springing up in France and Europe, as well as the amendments tabled in the French National Assembly and Senate.
536	I should also like to have answers to the question of what influence it would have on the volatility of the exchange markets, particularly what would be the effect of a tax of 0.1 per thousand on speculators expecting devaluation in the order of 20 to 50%.
537	In paragraph 26, moreover, it called for the establishment of an international arbitration organisation to cancel the debts of the countries of the South.
538	Indeed this is what has happened in the case of the euro over the year, whether we like it or not.
539	Further to the comment which Danielle Auroi made just now on the subject of the countries of the South, I would add that there are some expert estimates which provide some interesting figures, for instance, a range between USD 50 and 250 billion, which could be recovered by a Tobin-type tax, whereas, at the same time, the UNDP [United Nations Development Programme] amounts to USD 40 billion per annum, which would be sufficient to guarantee minimum living conditions for the hundreds of millions of deprived people in the countries of the third world.
540	In recent months the disease has been detected, inter alia, in various areas of France.
541	Now I would like to ask, while the French representative of the country holding the presidency is here, whether this slaughter of cows will be paid for out of the EU budget or will you be paying for them out of your national budget, and whether, in your opinion, it is indeed appropriate that they should be paid for out of the EU budget.
542	I beg your indulgence to hear the answer please.
543	Any action by the two governments concerned is therefore limited by this international law.
544	It escapes me how the Commission can give this estimate as early as February and the Council in July.
545	By acting in this way in the name of subsidiarity, the Union is, in actual fact, shirking one of its responsibilities, as it has in recent weeks both in northern Italy and in Spain.
546	As an MEP who cares about that majority, how can I endorse the spending of GBP 11.5 billion of UK taxpayers' money - that is our current annual contribution - when it does not have broad public approval?
547	If the Council took a flexible position, we could reach an agreement at second reading in order to close the budget.
548	If anyone needs convincing, just look at the evidence.
549	This strategy has already been introduced by Joan Colom i Naval, the Vice-President for buildings.
550	As Commissioner Schreyer has already mentioned, there are many political announcements coming out of this year' s Budget: the reorganisation of agricultural policy, new structural programmes, measures to ensure better implementation of the structural policy, and steps designed to follow up the decisions taken at the Lisbon Summit for creating a stronger and more competitive EU and for combating social exclusion.
551	The NATO war destroyed too much and left too much suffering in its wake.
552	Despite what has been agreed, I sometimes wonder if it is possible to achieve this objective within existing budget constraints without undermining the agricultural budget necessary for a sustainable rural sector in existing Member States.
553	And I am telling you loud and clear: Kostunica must be given his chance here and I therefore hope that he will give amnesty in the next couple of weeks or months, but meanwhile, I do want the introduction of those two new budget lines, democratisation and reconstruction, to be accompanied by political conditions, both from a political and budgetary perspective.
554	The elections in Yugoslavia have shown two things: that the people have finally had enough of the dictator Milosevic and that they have confidence in Professor Kostunica.
555	I am sure that the Albanian political prisoners will also be released soon.
556	If the financial perspective is not revised, we will inevitably be caught up in "financial engineering" , in redeploying resources and in cuts, either in general expenditure, social and environmental spending or in cooperation.
557	In this connection, efforts are required to solve the major social problems, for example unemployment.
558	There is, of course, one crucial event, namely that a start has been made with category four and with looking at ways how we will deal with it, but it is not yet entirely clear whether we have managed to resolve this, partly because the Council refuses to have sufficient input in the attendant thought processes.
559	Prioritising is important in all Budget work.
560	This is not very serious with the expiry of the Treaty very close on the horizon, but it would be worrying if the post-ECSC legal framework maintained the possibility of prolonging such practices.
561	That leads to my third remark on what now faces us.
562	The new Finance Agreement is of no use, and I see that mistrust of EU politicians is growing.
563	I pay tribute to them for that.
564	The willingness of all the institutions concerned to discuss the matter resulted in exemplary cooperation which, it is my fervent hope, will make it possible for us to reach a consensus at the first reading.
565	Those of us who stand for European values in a Eurosceptic country are now being given further arguments in favour of the EU, namely more effective protection of privacy, which is important for the citizens of a modern society.
566	I now see that my own country is to alter the law relating to personal data which deprives elected representatives of any influence at all over the Commission' s decisions.
567	There are many other problem areas which require some pragmatic evaluation if they are to be practicable.
568	The Commission would first and foremost like to highlight the commitment we made to the citizens of Europe to ensure protection of the personal data processed by the institutions of Europe.
569	If this statement is made, the Commission will accept the scope of the regulation being limited exclusively to first pillar activities.
570	In order to honour the political agreement made with the Council and the rapporteur to enable the regulation to be adopted at first reading, the Commission rejects all other amendments which were not part of the Paciotti report adopted by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, except for Amendment No 69 which is a correction to Amendment No 41.
571	As a matter of urgency, therefore, the staff complement of the Interdepartmental Group attached to the Commission Secretariat should be strengthened at the earliest possible opportunity in order to ensure that all proposals for acts which are general in scope are accompanied, when considered by the College of Commissioners and on the basis of Article 299(2), by a simplified sheet outlining their potential impact.
572	From the point of view of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, what I would like to point out is that, in actual fact, we can only treat equally what is equal.
573	Given the importance of fisheries to the outermost regions, I can only be saddened by this.
574	So far, since an interdepartmental group was set up for the outermost regions under the presidency of Mr Delors, we have travelled a long and fruitful road, and I must express the deepest gratitude of the Europeans from the outermost regions to those who have presided over that group.
575	The fact is, even though, as early as the Treaty of Rome, reference was made to the French overseas departments, we had to wait until 1989 and the programme of options specific to the remote and insular nature of these regions, the notorious POSEI programmes, for the European Union to at long last acknowledge that the permanence and combination of structural handicaps affecting the outermost regions justified special treatment in comparison with the other regions of the Community.
576	I have no doubt but that the proposals which the Commission will submit to the Council will be characterised by these qualities.
577	This question will become that much more relevant the closer EU enlargement towards the East becomes.
578	It should be noted that this right to be different is nothing more than a demonstration of the principle of equality, which also requires different treatment for anything that is different.
579	It is a document which my team and I feel is full of ideas and proposals, which goes to the heart of the issues and does not dodge any of the areas of concern of the peoples of the outermost communities.
580	Your report, Mrs Sudre, quite rightly stresses the need to take long-term action.
581	As for the revival of the diversification of the economy, we have made progress in a number of key areas.
582	The important thing now is that a good number of projects are presented under the SPDs, but also, alongside this grass-roots action, we must consider in depth the specific needs of each of the outermost regions in relation to access to the information society.
583	Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
584	I will, of course, inform the President of what you have said.
585	I am concerned about the possibility of a general failure of numerous machines and rules which would then call the decisions of the House into question.
586	Both this food authority and the legislative proposals being proposed, which aim to guarantee food safety, will receive the support of this House, Commissioner.
587	Its key task is providing scientific advice, for the discussion on food safety must be pure too.
588	I would just like to thank the rapporteur for his constructive contribution and for his willingness to take on board the recommendations from other Committees.
589	When we are faced with a potential risk, it is important to apply the precautionary principle.
590	On the still vexed question of how far we should go in allowing it to look at nutrition, and indeed to offer advice and to be consulted by those whose primary concern is risk management, we have also said that where the issue of safety is involved, these issues also should at least be within the remit of the opinion and the advice of this food standards authority.
591	A central aspect of this is to ensure that the rich heritage of traditions can be preserved.
592	This respectability will be gained, not through laws or legislation, but through integrity, academic brilliance, neutrality, duty to be accountable, transparency and comprehensibility.
593	Sound scientific knowledge is certainly essential to help assess the risks linked to the food chain, from the farm to the table.
594	Mr President, it is clear that there is considerable enthusiasm for the establishment of a European Food Safety Agency, as our rapporteur would prefer to call it.
595	Given that the WHO programme remains properly funded and supported, there would appear to be no need whatsoever for yet another agency, especially one with such a limited reach as the 15 Member States of the European Union.
596	Food safety is a fundamental requirement for consumers, because they want to eat healthily, and we have to ensure that this is possible.
597	Without a new framework directive we will be helpless in many areas of food safety.
598	We must consequently make such changes to the EU Treaty as to ensure that the Commission is given the option of imposing sanctions in the area of food, just as it has at present in the area of competition.
599	I support everyone involved, be it in a political, administrative or other capacity, who is working on a "food for all" strategy.
600	I do not share this viewpoint, for we know that a human being is more than just a body.
601	It must genuinely be a centre for coordinating the network of national agencies which, in turn, must activate and coordinate a network of centres of excellence for food safety at the level of the individual regions.
602	I therefore believe that your Amendment No 11 and my Amendment No 17 are perfectly reconcilable.
603	The reform of European Union food laws would be carried out at the level of the European Union.
604	His report does not so much propose amendments as establish emphases.
605	We have spelled this out very clearly in the report, and I am absolutely delighted about it.
606	Yet, the creation of a European Food Safety Agency is a very positive step.
607	In the interests of the citizens of the Union as a whole, it is to be hoped that these criteria will be implemented.
608	I think there should be specific deadlines by which the European Commission must be notified if there is any cause for concern.
609	The EU must have the highest possible standards of food safety for its citizens.
610	The Commission is now proposing the creation of a European Food Safety Agency.
611	I am worried that Europe is again in danger of creating an overblown bureaucracy that is incapable of taking action.
612	As we create new levels of bureaucracy and spend ever more money we get less and less in return.
613	You must prevent several institutions carrying out similar work in parallel.
614	We must, however, ensure that in the wake of the debate on the White Paper, the fear of a bureaucratic Europe which concerns itself with the quality of products without doing anything effective to combat fraud that threatens the health of the consumer is not reinforced in the mind of the public.
615	As you are aware, the Commission attaches the highest priority to its strategy on food safety.
616	The Commission intends to adopt a proposal for a regulation establishing the overarching principles and objectives of food law, which will provide the framework for future health protection measures relating to food.
617	Thank you very much, Commissioner.
618	Turning to our report, I welcome the Commission's proposal as positive, and I have to say that the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Development and Cooperation have worked extremely hard in order to improve it - if this was possible - on certain points in particular.
619	As Mrs Bonino said, very clearly and explicitly, the Commission's proposal for a regulation is a further step forward.
620	The Commission' s draft regulation seems too vague.
621	Proper mine-clearance equipment therefore needs to be arranged and we need to finance research work on detection and clearance, and on equipment that is simple to use on the ground, which is particularly helpful for developing countries.
622	Over the last eight years we have contributed over EUR 200 million from the Community budget to the fight against landmines.
623	But we cannot penalise people when they have a lousy government.
624	Firstly, as I have already mentioned, I think it would be a mistake, well-intentioned but nevertheless counter-productive, to make accession to the Ottawa Convention a hard and fast condition for European mine-action assistance.
625	I cannot accept Amendment No 19.
626	Secondly, the international community needs to improve the coordination of its efforts both at the global level and particularly within the afflicted countries.
627	Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists shares the pride which Mr van Orden expressed a moment ago in the role of the European Union.
628	Think of the Soviet 'toy' bombs in Afghanistan.
629	Thank you for a good report.
630	Mr President, the Cambodians call mines 'everlasting sentinels' .
631	People have a justified mistrust of uniformed personnel, born of many years of war.
632	Mr President, I am pleased that we finally have European legislation, in the form of a regulation, on anti-personnel landmines and that today we have a good report on the subject by Mrs Bonino.
633	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing a very sad subject today.
634	It is no coincidence that most mines are to be found in crisis areas, i.e. in areas where a different sort of initiative could have been taken in order to resolve the crisis.
635	Two kilometres away from a hamlet in Bosnia, in 1999, a sign indicated the presence of mines in a field, but this did not stop a little boy going there.
636	It is tragic when the civil population suffers as a result of its leaders' lack of skills and experience.
637	Allow me to welcome you on behalf of our institution, with which your country maintains privileged relations within the context of our joint project to construct an area of prosperity, safety and peace in the Mediterranean basin.
638	All the mines are in storage.
639	Mr President, as I agree with almost everything my colleagues have said, I do not want to repeat it, so I shall give up my speaking time.
640	Your concept of open cooperation is a reversion to an institutional system dominated by Commission officials.
641	We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity whereby decisions must be made as close as possible to those they affect.
642	However, as the Group of the European People's Party's key amendments have just obtained a substantial majority, I have voted for the report.
643	Mr President, I abstained from voting on the resolution on the results of the informal Biarritz European Council for two reasons: firstly, because I had the opportunity to vote in person on Paragraphs 2 and 5 separately, which allowed me to express my total opposition to both.
644	In other words, among those sitting round the table of the common European home, some would eat Ã  la carte while others would get the dish of the day.
645	There is always room for improvement, of course, and democratic control must not be found wanting in this respect, but we did not feel that cataloguing these rights and including them in the Treaties should be the European Union's top priority.
646	There has been talk about referenda and the amendments that were made to this report in relation to referenda.
647	Only 40 per cent of people voted in the 1999 elections to the European Parliament, if countries with voting duties are discounted, as well as those which had national elections at the same time as elections to the European Parliament.
648	To achieve the desirable objective of a European Constitution it is inadvisable to impose rigid patterns and methods, which would inevitably lead to failure.
649	A genuine social constitution ought to bring together, from the top down, the best acquired rights for work, women, immigrants and citizens.
650	Although I do not reject the praiseworthy intention of strengthening, clarifying and deepening the European Union and of simplifying the texts so as to bring its workings closer to the citizens, I did not vote in favour of this motion for a resolution.
651	the allocation of powers and responsibilities
652	I believe it is absolutely crucial that the EU' s Charter of Fundamental Rights should involve subscribing to the Council of Europe's Convention on Human Rights.
653	However, Mr Gil-Robles' report is a help in this respect because it proposes that, for certain issues and sectors, some of the Member States of the European Union reach agreement upon joint actions.
654	To allow decisions on ever more important topics to be made on the basis of qualified majority voting would be in conflict with basic democratic standards.
655	It is now attempting to prevent reinforced cooperation being made more flexible, but here too it will eventually lose.
656	The report before us tends to consolidate Parliament' s position in this respect (resolution of 13 April 2000).
657	We are broadly in favour of so-called flexible integration.
658	The UK Labour members of the PES Group welcome the adoption of their contribution to the ongoing work of the IGC on reinforced cooperation, without endorsing every single detail.
659	These islands must be able to feel that they are an active part of the European Union, and I hope that the Union will turn them into a paradise both for tourists and for their inhabitants.
660	In the Middle Ages, those regions and their people did not belong to Europe, and even today, they are not really considered to be European.
661	The special characteristics of these regions derive in general from their island status and their distance from continental Europe, but also from their chronic dependence on only a few products or even a single product, and thus require specific measures designed to overcome these constraints.
662	Mr President, I apologise to the Presidency and to the interpreters, who have to listen to this last explanation of vote and, in particular, I sympathise with the translators of our explanations of votes, particularly, in my case, the Italian translator, Ornella Buson.
663	In fact it becomes clear that the purpose of the agency is to take over national defence powers, or to paralyse them, and to put them at the service of the Commission's objectives.
664	That does not prevent the Commission and Parliament from christening the agency a "European Authority", a title totally contrary to the philosophy that supposedly inspires it.
665	That is not at all what the Bowis report is proposing; it gives the impression that basically it regards food safety as another pretext for fuelling the well-known process of strengthening the Commission's powers at the expense of the national authorities and public safety.
666	So I think it appropriate for me to make a statement condemning these unspeakable acts on behalf of the European Parliament, which has always advocated respect for religious freedom and tolerance between all communities.
667	Madam President, I understand the rapporteur's objections, but the vote on the amendments tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development will not only be about money but also about a particular political line.
668	I should like to ask you also to support our making the necessary adjustments to budget line A-206, Acquisition of immovable property, depending on which amendments are adopted, so that we do not exceed our self-imposed ceiling of 20% of total administrative expenditure.
669	Before the vote on Amendment No 929
670	Section VI, Economic and Social Committee
671	Report (A5-0276/2000) by Mr Nicholson, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing additional technical measures for the recovery of the stock of cod in the Irish Sea (ICES Division VIIa) [COM(2000)0190 - C5-0219/2000 - 2000/0071(CNS)]
672	(Parliament adopted the resolution)
673	The export subsidies mean that the EU' s food surplus is dumped on the world market at low prices, as a result of which the food industry in many developing countries, for example, suffers serious competitive disadvantages.
674	To obtain sufficient economic funds for increased aid to the Balkans, the Member States must reallocate funds from the available budget.
675	Nonetheless, Parliament has succeeded in driving through a number of important priorities - especially, increased efforts in the fight against unemployment and poverty, a number of important environmental and equality issues, etc. We have voted against the right' s attacks on the LIFE programme and the European Women's Lobby.
676	- (SV) Where travel expense refunds for Members of the European Parliament are concerned, we maintain our view that refunds must be made only for actual costs incurred for travel on official business.
677	I am assuming - and I hope that the Commission will contribute appropriate constructive solutions - that we will have a transitional arrangement to fill the three years between 2002 and 2005.
678	It is with the purpose of effectively muzzling the national parliaments, above all, that the European Commission, in its frenzy of regulation and liberalisation, has tabled a proposal for a directly binding regulation rather than a directive, which is to be whipped through Parliament and the Council of Ministers with all hands on deck so that it can enter into force as early as 31 December of this year.
679	We therefore support the Commission' s efforts at reform and oppose further preferential treatment of this sector.
680	That made them heavily dependent on loans.
681	Nicholson Report (A-0276/2000)
682	It is important to ensure that aid funds are not used for military purposes.
683	We stand by the view that the cost of reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases should be paid for by the real polluters (i.e. large-scale industry) out of their excess profits.
684	Moreira Da Silva Report (A5-0271/2000)
685	This money should be spent by bringing into line and coordinating expenditure on research policy in all the 15 Member States of the European Union.
686	Out of precautionary considerations, it is useful to be clear about these substances.
687	That concludes voting time.
688	This is to replace the national format which is already widely in use.
689	The loss of data for balance of payment reporting statistics brought about by this change is minimal.
690	You have to bear in mind that small and medium-sized businesses are of course the ones primarily affected by this.
691	For years we have been pressing for the efforts being made to be harmonised.
692	I believe that this report is of central importance if we are truly to succeed in integrating the public and small and medium-sized businesses into the euro area and for increasing public acceptance of economic and monetary union.
693	In the free movement of capital involving the single currency, there should not be any restrictions or huge discrepancies.
694	Yet the European Parliament and the Commission genuinely attach vast significance to it.
695	I endorse the dual-track policy, by means of which the rapporteur hopes to spur the slow banks into action.
696	We cannot force banks to engage in unprofitable business, but, as politicians, what we can do is support the amendment tabled by Mr Radwan and Mrs Peijs, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, which calls for measures to be implemented before the end of next year, and, preferably, for these standards to be in place when the euro coins and notes come into circulation.
697	The proposal by Mrs Peijs and myself also seeks to bring the banks together around one table, not to lay down the law, but because we simply cannot increase the pressure any further from the political side.
698	After all, if the systems for making cross-border payments remain as expensive as they are today, the credibility of the new system of coins and notes will be called into question.
699	We are of the opinion that this form of collecting statistical data on the Union' s internal credit transfers is a vestige of the past which can no longer be justified in an integrated, unified area and which forms an obstruction to the proper running of the market.
700	Listening to what some Members had to say in committee, Members who have been in this House longer than I have, gave me the feeling that this multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship exercise that Parliament is going through for the fourth time belongs in that category.
701	Ladies and gentlemen, thank you in advance for supporting my report.
702	But if assistance is withdrawn at European level then the regions need once again to be given increased opportunities to act.
703	SMEs are the major source of job creation, in terms of both quality and quantity, and they play a crucial role in social cohesion and regional planning.
704	She has studied the proposals with great care, and she has taken the trouble to consult with the many parties concerned. That approach has been an asset in defining and optimising the implementation of this programme.
705	Thirdly, we must look for European added value.
706	It follows from this that small and medium-sized businesses only thrive if unemployment is low and if public budgets at all levels are free of debt and have sufficient resources to commit to the investment budget.
707	Enterprises need clarity.
708	Above all, when a one-man company or a company with fewer than 250 employees has a project, it should not need to provide 120% loan guarantees in the form of land to receive financing; it should also be possible for it to be funded on the basis of a good idea.
709	The national governments, and even the regional and local authorities, already act as gigantic finance pumps to siphon off taxpayers' money, that is to say the amounts levied on the majority of the population including the most disadvantaged, and pour this into big business and thence to proprietors and shareholders.
710	The nursery for small and medium-sized businesses contains several thousand experiments which feed large enterprises with manpower and ideas.
711	What I want the Commissioner to address above all in the range of measures that we have proposed here is making access to support and information easy and quick so that people running these businesses will be able to use the information effectively.
712	They will all have a place of honour in the multiannual programme.
713	Finally, I welcome the idea that we should review the implementation of the programme annually.
714	There is an urgent need, following the recent attacks on the Greek minority in Himara, to promote democratisation measures and measures to strengthen institutions and respect for human rights in Albania.
715	A considerable number of Albanians are leaving their homeland because of the instability in their country, because of the social difficulties and because of the pre-modern structures of society and family.
716	We need preventative measures specially tailored to Albania, which will provide support for building or rebuilding the country so as to enable people to live in dignity in the region.
717	Thus it is that documents have been circulating from one body to the next, and the European Commission, for example, refuses to make public the report concerning inter alia even the Customs Assistance Mission (CAM) established in Albania.
718	Let us try to see the truth with open eyes.
719	Mrs Karamanou, congratulations on the extensive, wide-angled approach in your report.
720	It is a very important issue which is being shaped by historical, social, political and economic factors.
721	We will never know the true death toll.
722	People with the same business affairs in common are peacefully bound to one another.
723	However, what I cannot accept in this report, and I will state this quite frankly, is that it confuses cause and effect, which is to say it confuses a procedure for the carefully considered issuing of visas, and hence the possibility of migration, with a cause, that of illegal immigration.
724	The enormous institutional changes that came out of the Treaty of Amsterdam have had an impact on the way asylum and migration are dealt with.
725	Thirdly and lastly, the action plan and its way of implementation must be observed regionally.
726	But of course, this request is also directed at ourselves to be sparing with European regulation.
727	It is particularly important for this strength of acting at Community level to be emphasised at this time.
728	I am also in favour of making codified proposals with regard to amendments to existing EC legislation, so that the amendments can be integrated into the existing directives or regulations.
729	The principle of subsidiarity, properly understood, points us in both directions: take decisions at the lowest level possible, but acknowledge that the lowest level possible may be indeed a very high level, when general goods are at stake that will be lost unless protected on the same terms everywhere.
730	The report is a model of concise and clear drafting and I hope colleagues will take that very seriously indeed.
731	The report by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market did not gain much enthusiasm from its Members.
732	I referred to this in the report on the SLIM project, because Community legislation - and Mr Medina has just proved it by reading out one of the articles of the Treaty - is difficult to understand, even for the experts.
733	I am therefore not very enthusiastic about certain aspects of the report, because I would have liked the report to have been more 'communitising' as regards the internal market, and on this point, especially, these are clearly not the prevailing winds in the report.
734	What is important for the EU institutions is that we have a strong commitment to improving the quality of legislation, especially with regard to subsidiarity.
735	The debate is closed.
736	This continuing state of affairs could have an adverse effect on the public's attitude towards the euro and its acceptance of it.
737	Mr President, we took a great deal of care over preparing the Karamanou report in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
738	So, as chair of the Committee on Fisheries, I would like to use our oral question and this debate to talk to both sides - since our motion for a resolution is addressed to both sides - about a few issues, and I would like to do so very calmly.
739	This is what the people of the European Union, whom we represent here, are demanding.
740	A great deal of water has flowed under the bridge since, and yet the agreement has expired and not been replaced.
741	I can understand the Commissioner' s reasons, but not those of the Director-General.
742	We could say that, eleven months after the docking, we are still paying for the previous agreement and the one before that.
743	Mr President, we had a similar debate a year ago and the fact that it has taken a year before negotiations even get under way shows how difficult it is becoming to find fish stocks for our massive EU fleets to exploit.
744	With the second agreement, things were very clear.
745	But we must also understand that nothing lasts forever, not even fish stocks.
746	I am therefore particularly keen to make it clear that if there is anything that sets the PPE-DE Group apart, it is not only in supporting, defending and fostering fisheries agreements, but also in firmly promoting their extension.
747	Thirdly, since the fisheries agreement came to an end, Community and non-Community fleets that are not subject to the control of either the Commission or the Member States have continued to exploit the Saharan fishing grounds, in particular a substantial Dutch fleet.
748	I can well understand why, because this type of fishing was a source of revenue and employment for what is by European standards a poor region.
749	Another aspect that I wish to highlight is the fact that at the end of this month, temporary aid paid to fishermen and shipowners in compensation for this year of inactivity comes to an end. This situation is unsustainable, since they would all rather work than receive aid.
750	This Andalusian MEP has been negotiating and proposing initiatives for a year in corridors, in offices, in the Committee on Fisheries and in the hearings with the Commissioner so that the highly specific idiosyncrasies of the Andalusian fishing fleet working in Morocco would be taken into account.
751	Spain has done a magnificent job in turning round the difficult neighbourly relations which Europe and North Africa and Spain and Morocco have suffered during the course of history.
752	As a Spanish and Andalusian MEP, I assert the rights of thousands of Andalusian and Spanish families to maintain and defend their jobs, which have been endangered for almost a year, and for us also to defend these jobs here in Parliament.
753	We shall now proceed to the vote.
754	An almost 12-year old story full of false hopes, stalling tactics, hopes and personal need, about placatory measures for those involved and tough defence of old rights against citizens seeking no more than their due.
755	As you know, the issue is very complex and concerns some seven hundred people working in more than 25 Italian universities.
756	If the Italian legal system is reformed and modified, as it was in respect of academic teaching staff, we do not think that the Commission can intervene given that every European citizen has equal access to all categories of professions.
757	The injustice is about two people doing the same job, working side by side, but on different pay and under different conditions.
758	Worst of all, I believe, is having to issue a warning that a court judgment in their favour may just be a set of comforting words and make no real difference in their lives.
759	I remind the Commission that I hope it will reply to the point that in the AlluÃ© case the ruling of the Court is as follows: 'Hereby rules, it is contrary to Article 48(2) of the EEC Treaty for the legislation of a Member State to limit the duration of employment contracts of foreign-language assistants in any event to one year, with the possibility of renewal where in principle no such limit exists with regard to other teachers.'
760	Well, I believe that these matters go to the very heart of the fundamental principles of the freedom associated with European law, particularly the freedom of movement, and no exceptions can be made to these principles.
761	There are still many fetters and many obstacles to this internal market, as today's debate has shown, and not just in this case.
762	We shall now proceed to the vote.
763	(The President cut the speaker off)
764	On behalf of this Parliament, I immediately sent to the President of Austria, Mr Thomas Klestil, and to the Chancellor, Mr Wolfgang SchÃ¼ssel, messages of condolence and support in the ordeal that a tragedy of this kind is for the victims, those close to them and the people of Austria as a whole.
765	Are there any comments?
766	I support Mr Ceyhun' s proposal, and I would be very grateful if the Council could clarify whether it really intends to put forward a new proposal with regard to this issue.
767	Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, our group regards this incident as being so important that we do not consider it appropriate for it to be dealt with in the topical and urgent debate.
768	I have the impression that you agree with their rationale, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, if I understand you correctly.
769	Madam President, some time ago in this House we discussed the issue of sanctions on Iraq.
770	It is urgent that before the proposed change by the British authorities is implemented we have a debate and the Commission indicates quite clearly where the law lies in this regard.
771	(A5-0314/2000) by Mrs Roure, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the initiative of the French Republic with a view to adopting a Convention on improving mutual assistance in criminal matters, in particular in the area of combating organised crime, laundering of the proceeds from crime and financial crime [10213/2000 - C5-0394/2000 - 2000/0815(CNS)].
772	Declarations must be followed by concrete steps to trace, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of crime.
773	The creation of a European area of freedom, security and justice cannot remain in the hands of a specialised agency under the sole control of national governments.
774	Furthermore, Article 8 of the draft Convention limits the reasons which Member States may invoke for refusing to provide assistance to "essential interests" .
775	Allow me to start by congratulating Mr Marinho on his work and to say that, although we need to support efforts to combat financial crime, we also need to be careful.
776	Of course, we must identify, prosecute and sentence people who launder dirty money on behalf of terrorists, arms dealers and drug traffickers.
777	Our task is to detect, trace, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of organised crime.
778	These things are in the amendments and, judging by the debate in the committee, I am very hopeful that Parliament will vote for them.
779	It seems to me that this set of initiatives is going forward in a way which risks setting at naught the protection provided by Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
780	In reality, however, it is not all as simple as that.
781	Lastly, Mr President, the Group of the European People' s Party supports the compromise amendment that we have reached with Mrs Roure on lawyers' activities.
782	The second measure, the second instrument, is harmonisation.
783	This is a Portuguese initiative that has already been commended by a number of previous speakers.
784	This was also the subject of the joint Justice and Internal Affairs/Ecofin Council meeting held on 17 October.
785	The best way of strengthening Parliamentary control of Europol is to fully integrate the Europol Convention into the European Union' s' judicial framework.
786	A step in the right direction, for which the European Parliament has been striving for a long time now, is the creation of a provisional unit for judicial cooperation.
787	This is the sense of the guarantees: to push forward this aspect of freedoms.
788	The European Parliament is the supranational Community body that can determine this relationship, and I therefore propose that you support its validity by showing support for our rapporteur.
789	Only when the institutional model and the rules governing the European area of justice are clearly defined will it be possible for citizens and Parliament to express their opinions on the individual measures proposed by the Council.
790	By strengthening the fight against serious organised crime, Eurojust is therefore a logical step in the efforts to provide citizens with a high level of safety within an area of freedom, security and justice.
791	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Gebhardt deserves our congratulations on the excellent report she has presented, dealing with one of the decisions taken at the Tampere Council.
792	However, since with Eurojust we are talking about the coordination of national public prosecutors and judges in order to combat all forms of serious crime - and on this point I agree with the approach taken by the rapporteur - this concept is being enlarged: we are no longer talking solely about cooperation on purely transnational crimes, but also about cooperating to counteract criminal activities.
793	We will have the opportunity to make our commitment to this provisional unit from 1 January 2001, but the Commission wants to sustain the debate on the form that the definitive Eurojust unit will take.
794	All sides gave their honest opinions - in my view - without falling back on inflexible opposing positions.
795	The problems that arose in spending were not of too much concern to the Fisheries Committee; other areas were of greater concern.
796	That we do not have clear targets, that we cannot measure output, is really unacceptable and would not happen in any other institution.
797	My second point concerns the hierarchy of staff with powers of authorisation. Here, Commissioner, overlaps which are actually unacceptable have occurred.
798	My point is that it has played a beneficial role in addressing a number of issues.
799	It is clear that this consortium approach does not establish a duality in terms of joint financial responsibility.
800	We have therefore worked very hard to recover the 3.4 million euros, and one could say that we are over 90% of the way there.
801	Are there any comments?
802	Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, after nine months' work and a long struggle for consensus, we now have a draft European Charter of Fundamental Rights.
803	I hope that, even though it can only say yes to this Charter of Fundamental Rights, Parliament will clearly apprise the Council of its demand for this Charter to be made legally binding over coming weeks, so that it can open the way to the European Court of Justice for the citizens of Europe.
804	As you know, this position is in line with that adopted by the Heads of State and Government at the Biarritz European Council who unanimously and unreservedly approved the Charter, and I can only urge you, therefore, on behalf of the Council, to follow suit, perhaps giving you a few reasons to do so.
805	I am convinced, however, that the Charter will make its mark most especially by the strength of its content.
806	The European Trade Union Confederation, for its part, saw fit to complain about what it considers to be some omissions, such as the lack of any reference to the right to a minimum income, for example.
807	The fact remains that several individuals, Members of the European Parliament in particular, have suggested that explicit reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights be included in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, which already refers to the European Convention on Human Rights.
808	With the exception of the British delegation, our group unanimously supports the Charter.
809	We in the European People's Party are jointly and firmly committed to including the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the Treaties as quickly as possible so that it can become a Charter of direct and unassailable rights for the people of the European Union.
810	They have shown that European issues can be worked with in a new and exemplary way, a way superior to that of the Intergovernmental Conference because of its open and democratic method of working, involving full public control and opportunities for citizens to participate.
811	The right to health, social security, accommodation or a minimum income either do not feature, or are expressed only as a token of social cohesion.
812	Fourthly, because the Charter - and this is particularly important for me - is based on indivisible civil and political human rights and fundamental social rights.
813	Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe this Charter is nothing more than the umpteenth example of the ability of the European Union and its Member States to proliferate empty texts and declarations of intent.
814	The Commission' s representative at the Turin Convention attaches judicial significance to the document.
815	Now that we have had the single market, it is now time for a Europe of rights The concept of citizenship within the European Union is a relatively new one.
816	The Charter has actually been drawn up as if it were a text which might become binding.
817	I am also very proud to see that a representative of my parliamentary group in my own country, Gunnar Jansson, played a very important role when this Charter was drawn up.
818	As I said last night - I will say it again today - there are too many failings in that respect all across this Union and sometimes, in our eagerness to develop judicial and police cooperation, we neglect the importance of ensuring that the innocent are not made the passive victims, the collateral damage of a war against crime.
819	Madam President, the draft European Parliament resolution on the Charter of Fundamental Rights has the same ambiguous foundation as the work of the body itself.
820	For example, the Italian Constitution lays down the limits of public morality and the European Convention lays down the limit of the rights of others and public safety.
821	Mr President, today in the vote at 12 noon we will conclude a process that began in 1984 when this Parliament approved the draft Treaty on European Union, which already contained the request for a declaration of rights, a process that we continued in 1989 with the De Gucht Resolution.
822	The Charter is going to have effects, whether or not it is in the Treaty.
823	That is to be welcomed, not feared as Mr Bonde seems to think.
824	It appears that the century which is coming to a close, with all its battles to emancipate the under-privileged social classes, has been in vain and has taught us nothing.
825	The Charter fills a gap in EC law and strengthens the individual' s protection against infringements by European police, by authorities which combat fraud and by authorities which regulate competition.
826	I do not understand how anyone can reject the Charter because it does not cover everything which they would like it to.
827	Mr President, I can continue where Mr Gahrton left off.
828	My third observation concerns the rights of citizens from third countries.
829	The Council of Europe, along with the Court of Human Rights, has a wealth of experience of such forms of supervision, and we can build on these.
830	As it stands, the Charter which we shall be voting for today - I hope by a large majority -, will clearly afford us better protection of our fundamental rights which is more in keeping with the times than acceding to the European Convention on Human Rights would have done.
831	This is why we need to take further steps forward.
832	I believe it is important to keep this in mind if we are to obtain the necessary backing for the Charter from Europe' s citizens.
833	Once adopted by this House, the Charter of Fundamental Rights will serve as a benchmark for my report and, as far as I can with my own personal and intellectual resources and those of the people assisting me, I shall carry out an evaluation, right by right and country by country, of the extent to which the Charter is respected in the fifteen countries of the European Union.
834	Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, first of all the Commission would like to endorse the comments made by the President-in-Office, Mr Moscovici, and to welcome the key contribution made by the Members of the European Parliament to the debate and indeed to the Convention, particularly the role played by Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo in the Praesidium of the Convention drafting the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.
835	I shall refer only to some of the salient points of this debate.
836	The Convention chose to include fundamental rights inspired by various texts of the Council of Europe, the Treaties and Member State constitutions.
837	The next item is the joint debate on the following two reports:
838	As matters stand, it is also up to the European Parliament to tell the Turkish people that there are, today, at least three conditions for accession which Turkey must meet.
839	Besides, conditions could not have been imposed exclusively by a decision of the European Parliament.
840	That is why I took careful note of the suggestions made by Mr Morillon regarding the preconditions for Turkey' s accession, which are certainly worth looking into.
841	I am delighted to be able to report that the Turkish Government has since acknowledged this accession partnership as the basis for further cooperation, giving us good cause to hope that we will achieve precisely what we set out to achieve, i.e. that our policy will help the forces of reform in Turkey give new impetus to the reform process and press on with reform in a bid to achieve membership of the European Union.
842	The most important thing, as far as I am concerned, is that Helsinki triggered a debate in Turkey, a public debate on the conditions of Turkey's accession to the EU, a debate which is supporting and bolstering the forces of reform in Turkey.
843	This text has been submitted for you to take a stand on it.
844	The aim now is to give the boost that is needed towards future accession.
845	I think that is wrong and I think it is dangerous. Nonetheless, I would urge Turkey to take this issue seriously, whatever the outcome of the vote.
846	The European Parliament will play its part in fostering relations with political parties, the NGOs and the press, as well as developing its tricky and sometimes fraught relationship with the Grand National Assembly.
847	Mr Morillon, in my view, your report is an exceptionally realistic and responsible report.
848	When you visited Turkey in March, you at least referred to the Kurdish problem by name, as you did here today.
849	The suggestion that the Europeans are going to bring about, I quote, "a radical change in habits and outlook" in the Turks is both extremely naive and extremely self-important.
850	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report troubles me.
851	Recommendation (A5-0325/2000) by Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on approval of the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (4487/1/00 - C5-0570/2000 - 2000/2233(AVC))
852	However, when we come to discuss the power of information in the future, we must realise that more widespread control, and the consequent provision of a greater guarantee for the human person, is a necessity.
853	Duff/Voggenhuber recommendation (A5-0325/2000)
854	For example, we note that:
855	The rights contained in the Charter are already included in national constitutions and safeguarded by national parliaments close to the nations of Europe and their cultures.
856	Article 19(1), for example, states that "Collective expulsions are prohibited" but does not specify that this ban may be suspended in the event of war or serious internal public order disturbances.
857	We shall offer a brief explanation of these three objections in order.
858	The right of a government arbitrarily to set aside its own constitution is the defining characteristic of a tyranny.
859	Let me reiterate today, however, that we all have every reason to be proud of the conditions in which we have entered this phase, which is so crucial for Europe.
860	A society which recognises only rights and not duties becomes selfish.
861	This is our priority fight in order to ensure that the affirmation of fundamental rights is put into practice in our political decisions.
862	While the Convention method is a valuable one, and productive in terms of drawing up a basic text that is seeking a broad compromise, all the same nothing can justify depriving the European Parliament, the physical representatives of the peoples of Europe, of the opportunity to amend and enrich the text.
863	The Charter must be improved, and the European Parliament must propose a strategy enabling it to be updated and enriched.
864	It should not therefore be decided and proclaimed at the Council summit in Nice; on the contrary, the summit should prompt a European debate on the Charter.
865	Fortunately the prevailing tendency of national governments seems to indicate the sensible path to take, which is to see the Charter as having power that is merely political rather than binding.
866	Established as "a body" by the Cologne Summit, it declared itself a "Convention" , a name with unfortunate connotations of 1793 when the French Revolution degenerated into the Reign of Terror under another "Convention" .
867	The method used, the cuts made and the ambiguity surrounding the very nature of the text, on the other hand, shed a harsh light on the new totalitarian agitators at work at the very heart of the process of European integration.
868	Fortunately, in this field, the European Parliament still has only a consultative role until the Treaty of Amsterdam is fully implemented, yet it is still finding occasion to abuse this role by putting the brake on reasonable decisions.
869	However, there are differing interpretations as to how this can be achieved.
870	That was the case a century ago, and although there was a crack down, it is now back in full force.
871	The last thing we want is that the single market allows criminals to enter the single market unseen by the back door.
872	We also support the future establishment of a convention to help combat organised crime and money laundering, and the various measures proposed in order to achieve those purposes.
873	In fact, a provisional cooperation unit is being set up, composed of a representative of the judges or police officers with equivalent competence from each of our 15 Member States.
874	Mr President, as a member of the EU-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee, I take a close interest in Turkey's accession prospects.
875	Turkey' s role in Cyprus is also unacceptable.
876	However, we back the rapporteur' s criticism that there is at present no effective assessment of the EIB' s loan operations and that there are deficiencies when it comes to public scrutiny and democratic control of the Bank' s activity.
877	Turkey, for all its differences, always was and still is an integral part of Europe.
878	Turkey' s accession to the European Union is an issue that has become even more topical.
879	Mr Morillon says that Turkey should try not to perceive the European Union as an exclusive Christian club which wants to keep it, Turkey, out.
880	Turkey will become an essentially democratic country once it learns to live with its past, just as democratic Germany has learned to live with its past - we asked the same of it.
881	Once the Ankara Government has understood that the status quo is not acceptable to Europe or to the rest of the world, then considerable progress may be made: the island may be reunified, and a fair and lasting global settlement may be achieved tomorrow in compliance with international law.
882	Why is none of this included in the European Commission's report?
883	It is within this balanced framework that we shall have to resolutely continue our work to promote rapprochement between the European Union and Turkey.
884	If you deal with the Armenian question in connection with the EU report - please read my lips: the Armenian question in connection with accession to the EU, then the project which we have discussed today will simply never get off the ground.
885	It is, moreover, the reason for our insistence on drawing up an assessment of the results of the first five years of implementation of the Barcelona process, in order to be in a position, in Marseilles, to establish the necessary guidelines.
886	Yet, we have managed to maintain dialogue even on occasionally sensitive subjects: stability, terrorism, emigration and human rights, for example.
887	The fact remains that the Council, particularly since 1995, has striven to allocate more extensive resources to the Mediterranean region, appropriate to the challenges of the partnership.
888	This is a hugely important issue and I say that as someone who comes from central Europe.
889	Mr President, there is as you know a saying in English that when the star does not appear in a show it is rather like a performance of Hamlet without the first grave digger.
890	We want to see the bringing together of policies on single market issues and agreement to introduce cumulation of origin side-by-side with the sub-regional free trade arrangements for all partners entering into free trade with each other and adopting the harmonised protocol on rules of origin.
891	We welcome with great satisfaction the news that the Commission intends to reinvigorate the Barcelona Process.
892	I have stressed these aspects because they contain the key to reinvigorating the Process, and the enhancement of the Barcelona political agenda must be added to all this.
893	Our priority must therefore be to ensure the peace and security of the European Union in the Mediterranean and we have to make every possible effort to achieve this cooperation and to ensure that the funds allocated are used efficiently, according to what we might call the selfish generosity of the European Union.
894	These are the important practical questions I wished to ask, and I should like to thank Mr Brok for allowing us to have this debate just before the Presidency and the Commission are due to discuss these issues.
895	The world is moving inexorably towards globalisation and, as a result, is having to organise itself into large blocks which act as protagonists on the great stage of world competition.
896	It is disappointing to see that the Mediterranean countries only called up just under a quarter of the EUR 4.7 billion budget of the MEDA I programme which expired in 1999.
897	In this respect, the proposal that the Commission has made for a new impetus is a positive one, and we fully agree with the two priorities that Mr Patten has set out in his speeches and repeated here this afternoon.
898	It is a warning call to the European Union to play a much more active role in the Mediterranean area, which historically and culturally has enriched our European continent.
899	What is much more serious, however, at the very moment when we are calmly exchanging points of view, often very divergent ones, within this Chamber, more and more Palestinians are being killed.
900	Aid for reconstruction
901	However, if, when it comes to December, we do not include the funds required to implement the regulation then all we are doing today is building castles in the air.
902	The procedures involved are often too complex, but we must not turn a blind eye, nor must we want to - and I hope the Member States do not do so either - to their part in this.
903	The media in that region have often been responsible for the tragedy they have been through, so it is essential to have a completely free media that acts in accordance with the rules that prevail in our democracies.
904	But I am also happy because I feel that Parliament has succeeded, by keeping the pressure on, in turning round a situation that originally left a great deal to be desired.
905	I repeat: unnecessary expenditure on unnecessary meetings really should be cut back.
906	However, we ought not to focus on Kosovo alone.
907	It is also unfortunate that a large number of programmes have been put in the so-called performance reserve.
908	At Feira, the Council considered those countries participating in the Stabilisation and Association Process as potential applicants for membership of the European Union.
909	I should like to remind you that the main priorities of the CARDS programme are the strengthening of institutions with regard to democracy and the rule of law, economic development and reconstruction, and regional cooperation.
910	The European Union was right to react positively to President Kostunica's accession to power.
911	It was first examined on 6 November.
912	Reiterating the calls made by the European Parliament in its resolution of 16 March 2000, what initiatives does the Presidency of the European Council propose to take with a view to playing a more active role so as to guarantee the full and complete application of the UN peace plan?
913	How can we even consider reviving this partnership without first resolving the conflict?
914	I can simply point out the fact that France and Germany - and here I am no longer speaking as President-in-Office of the Council - raised these questions during a bilateral summit in Vittel last week, where it was decided to form a working group in order to find a solution to the problem.
915	At the same time, the Union continues to provide substantial material aid to both countries through its various programmes, in particular its TACIS programme.
916	The question raised therefore provides the Presidency-in-Office with an opportunity to clarify several points.
917	I should also like to add that these two texts focus, in particular, on strengthening the framework of criminal law in order to fight organised rings of facilitators.
918	The report that was adopted by the Turkish cabinet on 21 September as a reform programme contains several planned amendments to the law, such as the inclusion of measures in the Civil Code that are designed to enhance effective equality between men and women in social and educational fields, ways to better combat domestic violence by training judges that specialise in family matters and, lastly, measures to prevent people that have committed crimes of honour from serving reduced sentences.
919	The Presidency-in-Office therefore has no answer to give with regard to this point.
920	Next week, a meeting of the European Conference will take place on my invitation in France, in other words a meeting with the candidate countries.
921	Do you think that the Austrian model, i.e. bilateral majority resolutions, will be used in future as a way of passing resolutions which bypass the European institutions and of forming a new institution or a new group in order to circumvent unanimity in the Council?
922	The Council did not receive a copy of this letter but the Presidency has, of course, replied to Mr Cem and all of the Member States were informed about the content of the reply given.
923	And what is his opinion of Mr Cem's position - the President-in-Office did not reply here - that there can be no link-up between the Cyprus question and furthering the Accession Partnership between Turkey and the European Union?
924	It must be remembered that the fisheries agreement with Morocco is much more than a simple fisheries agreement; as he knows, if this agreement were not reached, bearing in mind its significance, this fact might conceal a deterioration in the relations between the European Union and Morocco.
925	I must therefore express my scepticism about the result.
926	It is worth pointing out that the principle of the mutual recognition of criminal decisions, in accordance with the conclusions of the Tampere European Council, must make it possible to reinforce cooperation between Member States while at the same time reinforcing the protection of human rights.
927	Supplementary questions must come from other Members.
928	Furthermore, in the communication adopted on 4 October 2000 on the European Union' s oil supply, the Commission indicated that, at the European Council of GÃ¶teborg, it was planning to present a plan to save energy and to promote the diversification of energy sources, which should help to boost energy efficiency, especially in buildings and transport.
929	In the same vein, at the time of the vote on the resolution on the embargo as part of the Third Commission of the General Assembly of the United Nations which met on 9 November 2000, we launched an appeal to the Cuban authorities to cooperate fully with international organisations defending human rights.
930	It is therefore up to NATO to take the steps it deems necessary to prevent further accidents of this kind.
931	(The sitting was suspended at 6.55 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)
932	It is the prerogative of those handing out money to stipulate the political objectives and the Commissioner has done so on several occasions.
933	His symbolic presence here could open up prospects for the overall policy which we are pursuing.
934	If we treat the area as a region of political antagonism we shall be making a big mistake.
935	Parliament must be regularly consulted and updated on progress, and it is this, the second of the rapporteurs' requests, which we must all support.
936	The heads of government have also confirmed the Union's determination to back this process with technical and economic assistance.
937	It was Parliament which supported the Commission's proposal to create the European Agency for Reconstruction.
938	We do not think, as the House knows, that it is necessary to make an explicit reference to this in the regulation.
939	The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 p.m.
940	Leaders agreed to an expanded and updated Asia-Europe cooperation framework 2000 which forms the work programme for the coming decade.
941	I think that reminded us in Europe of the important role that we have in Asia, not just in economic and trade terms, though it has to be said that one of the reasons for Asia's recovery has been that we have kept our word to keep our markets open to Asian exports over the last two years.
942	I think it was an excellent political declaration but we still have a few problems here.
943	We know that the Commission values ASEM extremely highly and it has our wholehearted support on that score.
944	The existing machinery for transposing rules into Community law needs to be improved in order to increase legal certainty and to overcome its current sluggishness.
945	It should thus promote the setting-up of new regional organisations, beginning where the Community already has a presence, such as in the western Pacific and south Pacific.
946	It will truly make for sustainable fisheries.
947	I believe the future of fishing in international waters depends on these organisations, and the Commission must make every possible effort, Commissioner, to this end. To support the United Nations position in both the 1982 Convention and the New York one, which has been mentioned here, we must maintain a very active presence in these organisations in favour of responsible fishing.
948	That is why I believe there is a tremendous role for the Commission to play in going out there and encouraging the fishermen to come forward and cooperate with it and come forward with a solution that we can all agree to.
949	The Commission is also required to carry out a huge amount of work in connection with negotiations held within the framework of regional fisheries organisations.
950	Mr President, I have Mr Nicholson's problem in an even more acute form.
951	Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, these are the solutions advocated by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
952	We have sometimes even wondered to what extent the cyclical market crisis itself may not be caused by the speculative action of these business structures, which thus gradually take control of the sector for their own interests.
953	The extra EU subsidy proposed in Mr Garot' s report would, in my view, be quite unreasonable in a year such as this when, with Agenda 2000 and the forthcoming enlargement to include Central and Eastern Europe, we are to reform agricultural policy.
954	I really do think that what the rapporteur has done here is a brilliant achievement; it shows just what you can do with administration when you set your sights on a specific objective and the objective is clearly specified here.
955	On the one hand, the largest producers, or those integrated with processing industries downstream, would distance themselves from this measure, preferring the systems they already have: individual savings; bank loans and redistribution funds.
956	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin straight away by saying that, in principle, I welcome the Commission's proposal to set up a compensation fund, even from the point of view of Austrian agriculture.
957	I should like to thank the rapporteur for his report.
958	I fully understand why people want market organisation for intensive livestock farming, and why they should want to scrap agricultural policy for land-based production.
959	We have a common organisation of the market in pigmeat and we should not make the mistake of questioning the present common organisation of the market in pigmeat which, basically, works.
960	The Commission feels that it is only fair to subject farmers who participate in the fund to some sort of discipline, because they receive a certain income guarantee in return, whereas others, who do not participate, have no such guarantee.
961	(The sitting was closed at 11.10 p.m.)
962	The value added tax-based resources represent 36% and the traditional own resources are 15% of the total.
963	Another element of the reform that corresponds closely to a key priority identified by the Court is the increased focus to be placed on results and performance measurement within a framework of resource allocation that is consistent with predetermined priorities and objectives that are clearly defined and measurable.
964	That is to be welcomed and I would like to thank you most sincerely, Mr Karlsson, and also the Members of the Court of Auditors and its officials, for supporting the reform of the Commission in your report.
965	Mr President of the Court of Auditors, I for one warmly welcome the fact that you have announced your intention to prepare a special report, to carry out a special audit on this.
966	The reality as described in the annual report is, however, more sobering.
967	The number of errors occurring is too great for a guarantee of this kind to be given.
968	The amount of fixed assets has been set EUR 240 million too low.
969	I should also have liked the Court of Auditors' report to have been a little more user-friendly and to have provided a number of clear recommendations, for example one or two per chapter.
970	In 1995, a convention to protect the EU' s economic interests was adopted.
971	The Commission and the Member States should see it in this light and use the findings of this report as a tool for improving their performance in managing the EU's finances.
972	I know that this report and the work that Parliament is about to embark on in the context of the discharge procedure will contribute to greater vigilance when it comes to Community spending.
973	Right now, Madam President, I should like to stop talking and wait for someone from the Council to come here.
974	The Court, as in other years, has failed to point out exactly where those failures occurred.
975	Madam President, the enlargement of the European Union is looming, and the report by the Court of Auditors leaves us in no doubt that there is still a great deal of work to be done in the candidate countries too.
976	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we recently reached an agreement with the Court of Auditors under which we would be able to obtain advance information from the Court's annual report on a totally confidential basis, and we also agreed that we would be discreet about this.
977	I would also like to pick on the Council by asking why it is not moving forward on Article 24 of the Financial Regulation.
978	Perhaps some European Union common sense will help sort out the problem and give George Bush his rightful place in history - its dustbin!
979	We are not looking for scapegoats, either in our institutions or in our Member States.
980	First of all, on the procedure for presenting the annual report to Parliament and the Budgetary Control Committee, I am happy to listen to the assurances from Members of Parliament that the situation this year is more satisfactory than before.
981	But we will have a chance to go through all that.
982	When it is relevant, from the audit point of view, we mention everything that has to be mentioned.
983	Ladies and gentlemen, as I am sure you will have noticed, the last part of the speech by the President of the Court of Auditors was marred by an unfortunate bug that intruded between his speech and this Chamber.
984	Some amendments, such as Nos 1 and 18, deal with questions that basically concern the United Kingdom, and it must be said that all the groups from the United Kingdom, whether socialist, popular or green, have supported them vehemently and they have been approved in the Committee on the Environment.
985	Mr President, in March this year we adopted the directive on cableway installations designed to carry persons.
986	We believe that in such cases the trade should not be burdened with manufacturer's duties under product safety legislation.
987	We have heard the justifications for them and for the reprise of the industrial arguments which we heard in committee.
988	Provided the vendor can always inform the buyer of the nature of the goods and the limitations on the information that should be sufficient.
989	Finally, a brief question for the Commission about Article 4, which concerns European standards and the question as to whether they must be disclosed.
990	I welcome the fact that exceptions have been made for shops associated with charitable institutions and non-profit organisations, as well as for articles sold as second-hand goods at markets or car boot sales.
991	The reliability of product safety and after-sale care represent added value for a "made in Europe" label at a particularly difficult and crucial time.
992	Elsewhere, we are calling on the Commission to present a proposal on the safety of services, so it is not evident why we should or would want to regulate service aspects here and now, instead of waiting for the Commission's proposal, since it is becoming increasingly clear that problems with demarcation between different provisions will arise and that legal uncertainty will grow as time goes on.
993	I would only say a few words to present the main aspects of this proposal.
994	We now also provide for the possibility of opening the system to third countries, in particular to the candidate countries: simplification of procedures for emergency measures at Community level so that we can take rapid action following the advice of a regulatory committee.
995	This new requirement does not imply any substantial additional responsibility in the case of these kinds of shops.
996	To replace the word "producer" with "supplier", as proposed in Amendment No 11, would create more confusion than clarity, as there is no definition of supplier in the directive.
997	Although the Commission is in favour of quickly establishing a network, this has to be agreed between the Member States.
998	Such certification can always be used for providing evidence but cannot, in itself, be regarded as foolproof.
999	Having extensively explained why the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 23, 24, 28 to 30, 32, 33, 36 to 43 and, in part, Amendment No 7, the second part of Amendment No 21 and the first part of Amendments Nos 27 and 34, I can inform you that the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 2, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20, 22, 25, 26, 31 and 35 and, in part, Amendment No 7, the first part of Amendment No 21 and the second part of Amendments Nos 27 and 34, as these amendments constitute an improvement and clarification of the Commission's proposal.
1000	Clearly, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo feels that Italian Socialists may not be part of the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
1001	I do not think they are incompatible.
1002	As far as the order is concerned, I leave it to the discretion of the President to decide, and I repeat that I am against all three amendments.
1003	The Mediterranean countries which do not belong to the ÃU have to cope with particularly acute problems of economic development and regional inequalities are becoming more and more marked.
1004	With regard to respect for the dignity of legal immigrants, in the spirit of a harmonised European migration policy, in addition to legal instruments guaranteeing the fair treatment of immigrants, financial aid instruments need to be established for all those young people who wish to return to their native countries to start work when they have finished secondary education or a university course in a European country.
1005	I should like to highlight one point which frankly I see as a determining factor in this question: the lack of equality in the employment sphere.
1006	. (PT) Although somewhat belatedly, the Commission has presented its programme for the Community framework strategy on gender equality (2001Â­2005), which differs strikingly from previous programmes and, specifically, from the fourth action programme, which finishes at the end of this year.
1007	Nevertheless, I voted for the report because, on the one hand, various proposed improvements submitted by my group were taken on board, and also because the report calls for studies into the position of women in national labour markets and the inadequate access they have to social security systems, an area in which we need statistically relevant gender-specific data.
1008	- My party has serious reservations about Community law applying to the sale of consumer products, as against applying the concept of mutual recognition of standards.
1009	It is now, and the Labour amendments offer a guarantee that charity shops will be left untouched and will be exempt from the directive.
1010	Finally, Amendment No 15 gives the Commission free rein in determining the rules governing the languages used by the Agency, about which we are very concerned.
1011	Simplifying the decision-making process, creating decentralised operational centres (and not just in Pristina, which has gained in importance now that it has broken away from Yugoslavia) and dealing with the twin structure between the Governing Board and the Commission may prove to be the right moves in a bid to deal with the huge bureaucratic shortcomings at the European Agency for Reconstruction.
1012	We are therefore voting against both the Commission' s proposal and Parliament' s report.
1013	I therefore believe that there is a justification for modifying the present Community schemes in this area.
1014	In addition, such funds give Member States the opportunity, in the form of co-financing, to grant capped state aid to a greater or lesser extent.
1015	- (EL) Despite its serious shortcomings, the Morillon report is clearly an improvement on the Commission proposal as far as the partnership between the European Union and Turkey is concerned.
1016	We voted against it.
1017	Following the example of the rapporteur, we are bound to admit that Turkey has progressed on certain levels and that there are positive signs.
1018	Parliament had already undertaken the road to recognition as early as 1987, and the adoption of this amendment demonstrates Parliament' s consistency in this area.
1019	The Union must be more proactive and treat enlargement to include Turkey as a vital geopolitical strategy.
1020	Such ulterior motives are unworthy of Europe and unworthy of Turkey.
1021	For a number of years, as a member of the delegation for relations with Canada, I have been able to observe the operation of one of the regional organisations, NAFO (Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation), whose members are the countries of that region, including Canada, as well as all the countries that use traditional fishing zones in the region, including France, Spain and some other European countries.
1022	It will only be content when its own gunboat fleet, flying "ring of stars" flags, is enforcing its fisheries policies.
1023	What is important therefore is not to satisfy the Commission' s desire for domination by weakening the position of Europe, which would be in direct conflict with the correct application of the principle of subsidiarity.
1024	Ultimately, after some tough negotiating, an outcome was achieved that is worth defending.
1025	The objective of this proposal, which aims to replace three directives relating to waste incineration, is to improve air, water and soil quality and human health by reducing emissions of pollutants linked to incineration and co-incineration, notably dioxins, furans and heavy metals.
1026	I also think, however, that it is very important to emphasise that it is now no longer merely a question of discharges into the atmosphere but also of discharges into the water and the earth.
1027	The proposal has improved during the debate.
1028	The introduction of much stricter nitrogen oxide limits for new co-incineration plants such as cement kilns is also a step forward which will be an incentive for reducing emissions even though the standards proposed do not reflect the best available techniques.
1029	Mr President, honourable Members, forgive me - especially Mr Blokland - for being a few minutes late.
1030	In conclusion, this directive is a major contribution to the reduction of negative effects on the environment and the risks they pose to human health.
1031	In its fight to combat discrimination and social exclusion, and in terms of the responsibilities of each individual, the European Parliament will take pride in giving a strong impetus to the establishment of a system which will allow the essential principle of solidarity to be practically implemented.
1032	However, there are huge differences between one country and another and we have no detailed or comparable statistics to help us ascertain reliably what applies where, what works best, where the weaknesses lie etc., which is precisely why my opinion, which was drafted on the instructions of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, stresses the need, before any generally-applicable rules are introduced for supplementary health insurance, for the Commission to submit a Green Paper containing an analysis of all these separate issues, together with the relevant information.
1033	Hitherto, this has been somewhat taboo up to a certain point.
1034	The risk that the less healthy and the elderly may not necessarily be able to secure full private insurance cover because they represent too high a risk is quite unacceptable in terms of social development.
1035	The other viewpoint illustrated by the rapporteur' s initial statement and shared by a number of members is to promote regulations and codes of conduct which are needed in order to establish among insurers ways of organising costs on a mutual basis providing everybody with guaranteed access to high-quality care and to counter the risk of discriminatory practices developing together with risk and client selection.
1036	I think it is completely wrong that it should be money which decides who goes to the front of the queue.
1037	The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs' new proposal is correct, suggesting as it does that there should first be a review of the situation in the form of a Green Paper and that only then should decisions be made about whether a directive or recommendation is needed.
1038	There is at present an on-going discussion in the Netherlands about structural changes to the system.
1039	On this basis, the Commission should take the initiative and create solid cornerstones by way of guidelines for the Member States' health systems.
1040	So an absolute "one size fits all" solution for insurance is unlikely to be the answer.
1041	I therefore believe we should lend our support to what Mr Rocard has put in his report - and we congratulate him on it - asking the Commission to provide a service, a Green Paper which will enable us to see the current insurance situation in the Member States and also to define the future.
1042	Both are based on a three-pillar model with state, company and private provision.
1043	The EU has already produced a piece of legislation on supplementary pensions in the form of a Green Paper, which has resulted in a draft directive.
1044	Mr President, I would like to thank and congratulate Mr Rocard for his report and to congratulate Mr Marinos for his committee's opinion.
1045	This study can form the basis for a communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament proposing initiatives or measures.
1046	I am very pleased to be able to tell you that all the amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgets have been adopted.
1047	We support the various elements of the programme, such as a multidimensional approach to this phenomenon, measures on health, education, housing, cohesion and complementarity with other related policies and the involvement of both non-governmental organisations and the very people who are subject to social exclusion.
1048	This means we have to make the most of the growth phases of the cycle to bring the position back to balance or a surplus.
1049	In this respect may I just remind you that the last Ecofin Council asked the Commission to include in the assessment of the stability programmes from next year precisely this long-term aspect of public finances in connection with the ageing of the population.
1050	One of the positive characteristics of the Netherlands programme, as I have said before, is the special attention it gives to the impact of the ageing of the population on the exchequer over the coming years.
1051	For this reason, the budget result for the year 2000 in the case of Germany will give a surplus of one and a half per cent of GDP.
1052	If we add to that the fall in the exchange rate of the euro against the dollar, we have had an obvious setback in terms of inflation.
1053	They are also moving towards making a public pay-as-you-go scheme compatible with private pre-funding schemes, and of course they are also compatible with support for the setting up of specific investment funds, which may obtain long-term tax advantages and may help to deal with the ageing problem.
1054	This is thus our third guiding principle: the precautionary principle.
1055	It should be recalled that a number of proposed regulations are under discussion, which will reinforce the effectiveness and the relevance of the raft of Community measures and shall thereby, I hope, restore consumer confidence.
1056	However, this relatively low incidence is no reason for complacency.
1057	I was, frankly, disappointed that there was no acknowledgement in Prime Minister Jospin's statement yesterday of the hugely positive role played by the Community in recent years.
1058	Clearly, explanations are necessary for the increased incidence of BSE, not only in France but also in other Member States.
1059	The Commission's Food and Veterinary Office already affords top priority to Member States' controls in relation to protective measures against BSE.
1060	In relation to its safety, let me repeat that there is an extensive range of controls already in place to ensure that MBM does not pose a threat of transmission of BSE.
1061	Yes, difficult as it may be to believe, it took four years to agree a measure which I consider to be fundamental to public health protection.
1062	Mr President-in-Office, I specifically call on the Council to make known its opinion on the TSE regulation.
1063	In this situation, the only way to break the cycle of BSE infection is to place a complete ban on the use of animal meal as feed.
1064	On this subject, I want to point out that those of us in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party have tabled an amendment I hope will be voted through.
1065	Policies must change this situation so that those who are really responsible for this crisis can be penalised and so that precise decisions can make it possible for a first step to be taken towards ending this tragic crisis.
1066	They therefore need to be reviewed.
1067	The labelling of beef that was agreed on, which is a minimum form of labelling and only came into force two and a half months ago, does not make it possible for the origin of animals to be adequately traced, and we were very slow to ban specified risk materials.
1068	Public opinion must be fully informed of the characteristics of the test I am talking about.
1069	Back then, Mr President-in-Office, you did virtually nothing, just as your colleagues have done virtually nothing about the fallout from Chernobyl, the AIDS epidemic or contaminated blood, and always for the same reason: so as not to panic public opinion.
1070	The French ban will create a massive increase in demand, yet supply of this commodity is limited.
1071	Consumers have lost confidence and, in order to contain this phenomenon, there must be systematic BSE tests on cattle and sheep.
1072	What is far more important, in the spirit of the Commission proposal, is to work towards ensuring that animal meal complies with the highest safety standards.
1073	As far as the rest is concerned, for once, I agree wholeheartedly with what the honourable lady members, Mrs Ainardi, Mrs Auroi and Mrs GrossetÃªte, said.
1074	Well then, Council and Commission, you have a fair amount of financial leeway on which to base your robust policy.
1075	We must tackle this.
1076	Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I am happy to hear within this Chamber that the CAP must be changed at all costs.
1077	We denounced this here in Parliament, when Jimmy Goldsmith was here.
1078	Man's food must be safe to eat.
1079	I think that France has set an excellent example by finally deciding to take this step.
1080	But you are not helping them to achieve this!
1081	Therefore, I am amazed, under these circumstances, that it is still permissible for corpses to be used or processed.
1082	Recently, the Phillips inquiry into BSE has been published in the UK.
1083	I would suggest that the European Commission also use the precautionary principle in regard to beef from France.
1084	As there is still a lot of uncertainty, we must know what the scientific facts are and what action must be taken.
1085	I have listened to all these proposals - I am not insensitive to them.
1086	If people from Member States come and tell me that the legislation has not been properly or fully implemented then maybe we will have to think again, but it will not be because the scientists tell us it is necessary, but because there is a failure to comply with the law in the European Union.
1087	Not inviting us to participate is the best way to avoid having to listen to us.
1088	The Commission considers that readmission agreements have an important role to play in clarifying and coordinating these policies, and the first Community readmission agreements are currently being negotiated with Russia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Morocco.
1089	What proposals does the Commission have concerning this matter on the basis of Article 31 of the Union?
1090	(The President cut the speaker off)
1091	The aim during this period has been to reduce government deficit in order to achieve a more flexible monetary policy, lower interest rates and greater growth.
1092	I always say that the euro will not be introduced on 1 January 2002: the euro is already in our pockets; we have it in coins of different guises, but we already have it in our pockets.
1093	The ozone thresholds pursuant to Directive 92/72 were not exceeded in the city of Athens, but it should be noted that no measurements were made in mid-summer.
1094	Subject: Government aid to the audiovisual sector During a seminar on the arts sector organised by the French Presidency, a representative of the Commission's Directorate-General for Competition expressed the view that the legal requirements to invest imposed on the networks constituted government aid by virtue of the very fact that such investment was made compulsory by the legislative authority.
1095	It must be respected and protected' .
1096	This is not self-evident as this new growth is very unfair and, as we have seen in the United States for some ten years now, may be accompanied by persistent insecure employment, exclusion, poverty and urban ghettoisation.
1097	The governments of the Member States did not accept this definition, which is also rather simplistic and unduly bland.
1098	In the harsh climate which then arises, there are more and more people who cannot keep up and who are marginalised and excluded.
1099	Mr President, in this Chamber we never cease to sing the praises of the European Social Model, the social market economy, which many feel with pride compares very favourably with the primitive model of the United States of America.
1100	(Technical fault)
1101	This is an enormous figure.
1102	Moreover, all political levels must be involved.
1103	I support the need to gain more knowledge about the causes of poverty and I also support preventative action against exclusion resulting from mergers, industrial change, relocations, rural desertification, and urban ghettoisation, with innovative and tangible responses involving both sides of industry, local and national government and concerted action by the public.
1104	There has been a very interesting debate on the role of employment in combating social exclusion and the role of the social reforms and of the structural reforms.
1105	This is a legalistic problem because, according to the Treaty's wording, the reference concerns only social exclusion and not poverty.
1106	I believe that these proposals constitute a pragmatic response to your request.
1107	However, the fact that we accept this strategy does not necessary mean that we accept all the detail.
1108	If we define a clear, binding framework for the Member States, then there should be a longer evaluation period for the various support systems required to satisfy these requirements.
1109	Energy from renewable sources will not be a panacea that will solve this problem, but nobody doubts that it can contribute greatly to alleviating it and also to diversifying our sources of energy and reducing our dependence on hydrocarbons, which indeed would not be a bad thing.
1110	I am going to repeat three of our demands.
1111	Stipulating realistic target figures can only increase public confidence in the energy policy to be pursued.
1112	I believe that a strong policy on renewable energies is a symbol of the Europe of tomorrow.
1113	Finally, the European countries must demonstrate, via these agreements, that they will contribute to the realisation of the Kyoto objectives.
1114	It seems a pity to exclude any category which can contribute to the overall achievement of energy from waste - whether it is for small-scale projects or part of the overall calculation.
1115	The formation of peat by assimilation and the production of organic debris are the same as with other plant biomasses.
1116	I would like to inform Mr Chichester that off my own seashore there are already well advanced windmills in the sea, certainly a project that is going to be up-and-running within a short space of time, so I would like to invite him to come and see it when it does get-up-and-running.
1117	The controversy over ending the use of nuclear power, for example in Sweden and Germany, has shown that without any visible energy alternatives produced at a competitive price and which are environmentally friendly, the debate is surely lacking something.
1118	That is why Member States must have binding objectives.
1119	Hence, I am optimistic about the future potential for renewables provided the right incentives are put in place.
1120	I believe that it takes great courage to keep renewable energy in the spotlight in the way she has managed to do.
1121	A dramatic increase in the price of oil without doubt starkly highlights the problems relating to our dependence on energy from fossil fuels.
1122	Therefore, we cannot accept Amendment No 28.
1123	However, while doing so, the Commission is very conscious that the terms used should not prejudice its right of initiative and must not be incompatible with the single market for electricity.
1124	In the Commission for the Reconstruction of Tajikistan, which has 25 000 widows, only one of 26 participants was a woman.
1125	Despite the fact that only a limited number of women have been involved, studies show that women' s participation in the UN' s peacekeeping forces improves relations with the local population, as well as general morale.
1126	The Theorin report goes into a lot of detail and repetition, which we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats consider do not belong in an official document.
1127	Politically speaking, I would be more inclined to interpret the amendment in question, i.e. Amendment No 19, as a tactical defeat or a tactical withdrawal than a compromise on the substance, and in truth that is unworthy of this women' s issue.
1128	They were held prisoner.
1129	Portugal, which only opened up its diplomatic service to women following the "Revolution of April 1974" , has recently demonstrated with the case of East Timor and our ambassador to Indonesia, Ana Gomes, how the role of a woman and her sensitivity to the problems and sufferings of a people that fought unaided for its freedom for 25 years can be recognised by the whole world and especially here in the European Parliament.
1130	Remarkably few have done so up to now; only two or three, so I am told.
1131	That is why this dimension needs to be taken into account when drawing up European Union policies in the future.
1132	Unfortunately terms are not defined and distinctions are not made.
1133	Please communicate our protest to the Council.
1134	They are people with different experiences and these experiences are essential to the way in which policy is applied, especially in conflict management.
1135	The debate is closed.
1136	Secondly, if it is our intention to regulate the sector, then naturally we need to investigate a number of aspects.
1137	I have discovered over the past few weeks that there is a great deal of interest, both within international trade union circles and within a number of national trade union organisations.
1138	Argument two: are you in favour of introducing pay for housewives?
1139	All those who are at present engaged in illicit work would obtain work with decent social conditions.
1140	In addition, as a result of this project, two or three families have often clubbed together to employ a domestic help.
1141	We were sitting in the first part-session in October when, at the time we were debating the situation in Yugoslavia, we learned of the courageous reaction of the Serbian people and, ladies and gentlemen, you well remember I am sure, we immediately called for international sanctions to be lifted.
1142	Thereby Europe has demonstrated the vitality of its civilisation within the framework of world history, and its capacity for creative political imagination for its future development.
1143	There cannot be any doubt that the issue of Kosovo's status is a democratic issue.
1144	On the other hand, we would like to be given a chance to prove to Europe that we are able to develop the constitutional equality of Serbia and Montenegro within Yugoslavia on our own, by recognising the genuine principles of democracy.
1145	I feel bound to say that, while I listened to you, I was struck by your mastery of what must have been a difficult situation and also by your determination.
1146	That will be put in order in the next Minutes, Mr Watson.
1147	Access to documents and information regarding the activities of the institutions enables citizens to hold the EU governing bodies accountable and stimulates greater efficiency.
1148	I consider a fifth important amendment to be that relating to the annual report, which must relate specifically to the documents that must be kept secret, or which are kept secret at any rate.
1149	This is a vague area, and it is possible that more restrictive provisions may also remain in force, and this is one point in respect of which we have tabled amendments.
1150	The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy objects to the idea that documents relating to foreign affairs and security issues will automatically and collectively be excluded from public inspection.
1151	If we really want to make it easier for the citizens to exercise their rights in practice, we will need specially trained staff in these contact points, who can, so to speak, take the citizen who is seeking information by the hand and guide him through the complex labyrinth of the institutions.
1152	Registers are important if we are not to have a form of public access to documents that is insider access.
1153	It is gratifying that Parliament has succeeded in producing a large majority in favour of more openness.
1154	Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteurs for an excellent piece of work.
1155	Mr President, transparency and openness do not appear in a good light in the European Union.
1156	If it were to be the case then it is a miscalculation because this is about the credibility and reliability of the European Union in the eyes of the citizens.
1157	There is a multiplicity of documents nowadays, and we should like to ensure that there is a high degree of access to as many different types of document in as many different forms as is humanly possible.
1158	Mr President, the Commission' s attitude to the right of access to documents may be seen from the internal handbook sent on 11 October to employees of the Commission to tell them how to deal with requests from MEPs for access to documents.
1159	This provision must be deleted or at least supplemented by the obligation to weigh up the various interests.
1160	The usual method of international cooperation, with all the customs and ground rules of diplomacy including the rule that everything must take place behind closed doors, will not do in the modern form of cooperation the EU has developed into.
1161	We must not confuse this with the role of the European Parliament or with future interinstitutional agreements.
1162	In my opinion, a step has been taken towards making it possible for citizens to avail themselves of their right to information and knowledge.
1163	However, he is not the only one I should like to thank, as my sincere thanks also go to Hanja Maij-Weggen, of the PPE-DE Group, who is the other rapporteur, thanks to the enhanced Hughes Procedure.
1164	Transparency must become a founding pillar of all the work of the European Union, but the right to access documents is still not enough in itself to establish transparency.
1165	That is why Parliament is calling for European security and defence policy to be embedded in the structures of the European Commission in future.
1166	When President Prodi addressed Parliament on 3 October, he referred to the institutional triangle and stated that, in a European system based on checks and balances, the efficient functioning of each institution contributes to the common interest.
1167	I must acknowledge that the great challenge of this regulation is the precise definition of what documents are.
1168	I would like to highlight that, at the right time, the Commission could accept practically all the amendments, such as Amendments Nos 9, 18, 21 in part, 23, 25, 26.1, 28(f), 35, 38, 40.1, 40.6, 41.1, 42, 43.1, 47, 49 and 52.
1169	Sometimes I would indeed like to vote for the Commission' s proposals and that means that Members really do need a list of the amendments the Commission can in fact support and of the amendments it does not wish to support.
1170	Own funds of banks
1171	Lastly, and most controversially, the committee strongly called for the use of a fast-track procedure to implement this legislation.
1172	These amendments replace various other proposals in the report that will probably be rejected in the vote and which will then be replaced by the new amendments arising from this consensus
1173	Mr President, in the light of the excellent vote of support for this report and given the Commission's response this morning, it is obvious - if you look at all the parts we have voted on - that under Rule 69(2) we should postpone the vote on the draft legislative resolution in order to allow us to enter into fruitful negotiations with the Commission and the Council.
1174	Mr President, I apologise for saying that the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats had also requested that the vote be postponed, but your coordinator in actual fact came to me and said that you also wished to postpone the issue until the November II part-session instead of taking the vote this evening.
1175	The reason why I would suggest that we postpone the vote is because - as Mr Goebbels has said - it is a very important issue.
1176	I do not know how much roll-call votes cost, but no doubt it comes to hundreds of thousands of French francs, or Belgian francs, out of our budget.
1177	I know that in France they have had whole herd slaughter and this does not seem to be the best way forward.
1178	remove meat-and-bone meal from animal feedingstuffs, not just for cattle and sheep but also for pigs, poultry and fish,
1179	That is unacceptable.
1180	These are the kind of measures that will reassure the citizens and that will send the farmers the message of solidarity we want to convey to them.
1181	It is crucial that we go further and promote a change in the common agricultural policy.
1182	The ban on the use of meat-and-bone meal for feedingstuffs is only the first step along this road.
1183	At the same time, we keenly regret that the amendments our group tabled were not adopted.
1184	I feel that it would be appropriate to reduce the working hours of the people who work in pollutant companies.
1185	I will conclude by emphasising once again that the widespread treatment of hazardous waste must not lead us to tolerate the production of such waste.
1186	If indeed, for example, pensions were less inadequate in terms of the standard of living they allow, there would be fewer poor people.
1187	The report proposes a budget of EUR 100 million over five years to combat poverty.
1188	I unreservedly support the proposal to implement a second Luxembourg process to deal with social exclusion, containing guidelines and national action programmes.
1189	The report calls for qualitative and quantitative indicators of social exclusion to be established.
1190	In submitting its proposal for a programme to combat social exclusion, the Commission is complying with the Council' s call to present "by June 2000" an "initiative for cooperation in this field".
1191	Mr President, I abstained from the vote for one specific reason: in my opinion, this report has not made the environmental progress that I hoped and called for.
1192	I call for a similar system to be adopted in all the towns of Europe.
1193	Some of the European Parliament' s proposals are unrealistic and I cannot endorse them.
1194	Moreover, in future we must do more to make existing best practice more widely known to the public.
1195	Environmentally-aware high-earners are free to make a voluntary contribution to cleaner forms of energy, within a liberalised market, whilst everyone else carries on in the same old way.
1196	The first item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
1197	The three reasons are as follows: firstly, because it promotes the process of the consolidation of democracy and the deepening of the demand for human rights to be respected, particularly in relation to indigenous populations.
1198	Mr President, in this debate, we wish to express - as many previous speakers have done very effectively - this Parliament' s solidarity with, and support for, the Central American Parliament at a time when we are fighting to continue to prioritise the European Union' s external relations with the countries of Latin America.
1199	I do not share the reservations expressed by our honourable Member, the Chairman of the Delegation for Relations with the Countries of Central America and Mexico, Mr Seguro, with regard to the issue of human rights.
1200	Finally, in the dialogue with the Central American authorities, the Commission is also reiterating the importance which must be attached to the process of regional integration as an instrument to consolidate democratisation and development in the region.
1201	In order to hold on to power, he did not hesitate to exploit the bitter debate on Ivoirian nationality, sparking an explosion of xenophobia: hatred of others, of foreigners, whether from Burkina Faso or Mali, even though so many of them have lived and worked in the country for many years.
1202	Real democracy cannot now be established in CÃ´te d'Ivoire unless an independent commission of inquiry is set up to look into the crimes committed and unless an official undertaking is given on respect for human rights and civil peace.
1203	Some people believe democracy is only of relative importance when it comes to Africa, that democratic procedures are a complex matter, that we have to give it time, but I personally believe that there can be no compromise with democracy and the question that arises for CÃ´te d' Ivoire today is the same one that arises for Guinea, for example, where we now know that there are people in prison and that the system is not democratic.
1204	Let me finish by saying this: dictatorships come into being only because there are people who are destitute and who have no access to learning, no access to knowledge.
1205	It would not be illogical for the European Union to immediately demand new presidential elections, in which all candidates would be able to participate this time round.
1206	Very many parts of Africa comprise very many different ethnic and religious mixtures.
1207	These elections must enable the political parties that were excluded from the presidential election to be represented at national level and thereby compensate, though only partially, for the defects of that first election.
1208	on the situation in Burma
1209	They are conducting a major offensive against the Shan people and the Karen people and, as the UN rapporteur has said, there is no sign of any dialogue between the SDPC and the NLD.
1210	We therefore reaffirm the importance of this resolution and the firm commitment of the Commission and the Council in this direction.
1211	I hope that, by prioritising this issue as an urgency, this Parliament is giving a clear message to the Burmese people that their plight is not forgotten and that we recognise that the situation in Burma is worsening rather than improving and are determined to try and do something about it.
1212	It has taken a long time.
1213	There is a particular risk in Asia of dissociating economic and political reforms, of economic progress and economic liberalisation without political liberalisation or greater constitutional legality. I believe that without a constitutional state that is functioning properly, in the long-term Asia will lose out on trade, subsidies and investments.
1214	Mr President, I agree in many important respects with the previous speakers, because much of what is happening in Vietnam today is unacceptable.
1215	Now, however, Human Rights Watch, as Mr Swoboda mentioned, is saying that Vietnam has recently taken steps to improve the situation regarding human rights.
1216	These extremely secret documents give us a rare look behind the scenes of Vietnamese government policy.
1217	However, the Commission remains convinced that a lasting solution to the current situation can only be found by means of dialogue between the military regime, the democratically elected opposition and the representatives of the ethnic minorities.
1218	There is also clear pressure from the Vietnamese authorities for their own press to operate a system of self-censorship.
1219	The next item is the debate on the following motions for resolution:
1220	We also require the EU to give help and assistance, not just in the southwest but across all of the areas that have been affected.
1221	I ask you all to support our resolution.
1222	It is vital that the Union does not restrict itself to making one-off interventions after disasters have occurred.
1223	The Commission has taken two initiatives along these lines.
1224	Mr President, a purely linguistic error has occurred in introducing one of the amendments in the joint resolution.
1225	Postponing the vote would mean postponing the task we entrust to the Commission.
1226	(Parliament adopted the resolution)
1227	The report takes as its starting point the observation that an ever greater proportion of health insurance in Europe is covered by supplementary health insurance schemes.
1228	I find it rather odd that people are already trying to tie the Commission's hands in relation to the proposal for a directive, while at the same calling on it to present a Green Paper on the current situation with regard to optional and supplementary health insurance schemes.
1229	At a time when the population is ageing dramatically, it is crucial that we look at improving the health care system for people across Europe.
1230	Obviously we cannot accept that.
1231	Mr President, there is a strong case for fast track when it comes to implementing the results of the Basel review on bank capital adequacy.
1232	As for the sense of urgency that Mrs Villiers has added to the Commission' s sense of the need for these measures by calling for a fast-track procedure for adopting them, we have to say that the rapporteur herself acknowledges that these new rules will have no effect on the anti-competition practices that are, alas, so widespread in the United States.
1233	Of course we must also make sure that Basel does not produce a second disadvantage for banks, as a result of higher own-funds requirements.
1234	Having made this initial comment, I should like to point out that I believe that economic operators are also satisfied with the approach adopted towards these regulations on capital, which help deal with the issues related to risk.
1235	These are a few initial thoughts on how we might succeed in devising a rapid legislative process which is controllable and efficient within the current Treaty regulations.
1236	The time has now come to acknowledge that the institution of the 'European Ombudsman' is sufficiently grown up and has shown sufficient signs of maturity to have its own budget.
1237	The EPP/ED Group supports the view of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that the Ombudsman's competences should be enlarged and the sooner the better, especially in the fields of the Ombudsman's investigative powers laid down in Article 3 of the 1994 decision.
1238	An Ombudsman is naturally bound by secrecy provisions, but it is good for citizens to know that, as Ombudsman, he or she can obtain access to documents which they cannot access themselves as citizens.
1239	Accordingly, the point of departure of this report was the recommendation by the Ombudsman to the Commission to give applicants access to their own marked examination scripts during the selection procedure it organised.
1240	We believe that the institutions of the Community should conduct their staff recruitment procedures, and indeed all recruitment procedures, with a maximum of openness and transparency in order to avoid the suspicion of partiality, injustice and administrative incompetence.
1241	I am referring here to an amendment on the need to provide indisputable proof relating, for instance, to oral test procedures.
1242	My colleague, Mr BÃ¶sch, has already briefly presented here the amendments to the report he tabled.
1243	When I tabled two questions to the Commission on the management and organisation of the last internal competition, I received clear, detailed replies.
1244	This is the beginning of opening up the process of government and making it transparent.
1245	Firstly, the corrections to the examinations set by the Commission are always made anonymously.
1246	Obviously, I was talking about July 2000.
1247	VOTE
1248	(Parliament rejected the proposal to postpone the vote)
1249	- (DE) In assessing the Directive on the own funds of banks, a number of conflicting interests have to be carefully weighed against each other.
1250	That is how the idea of a European Police College for the Member States of the European Union and for the applicant countries arose.
1251	This is also the position advocated by the rapporteur, and it is shared by the European People' s Party.
1252	Social conditions in most Member States of the European Union are now such that there is indeed a great need for cross-border cooperation between the various police forces.
1253	The majority of those who have spoken so far seem to think that it is vital to have a single permanent seat for the college.
1254	Yet another interim but not so short-term decision, another little present to Parliament from the Council.
1255	The rapporteur wishes to see added crime prevention, provision of services, innovation and border surveillance and also wants internal security modified to include maintaining law and order.
1256	Those were the ideals that they proposed to us and that was the sort of state that they worked for.
1257	I will welcome a levelling-out of standards in some Member States in the European Union.
1258	From the first discussions on this dossier, which were held at European level at the initiative of the European Parliament, the Commission has given a commitment to the Member States to pursue a course of action designed to develop what we might call a European police culture, grounded in the highest standards of duty, respect for the rights and freedoms of our citizens and efficiency in the fight against crime.
1259	The Council wishes the Police College to develop primarily with an intergovernmental approach.
1260	For these reasons, the Members of the European Parliament from the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against the report.
1261	- (SV) I have voted against the report on the provisional establishment of the European Police College.
1262	Undoubtedly, many of our courts are very slow and ponderous, and there is great difficulty in getting them to act quickly on these issues.
1263	The regulation which has been put forward is by no means perfect as it is linked to the Brussels II Regulation, which does not cover children whose parents are living apart and children of unmarried parents.
1264	My mother lived through such a separation and abduction 85 years ago, and she still talks about it.
1265	What I therefore wish to tell Parliament is that, in the action programme on the mutual recognition of judgments in civil matters - which we hope will be adopted by the end of this year - the Commission proposes that the first and utmost priority should be given to extending the scope of the Brussels II regulation and, consequently, of this regulation on rights of access, covering both the children of married couples and those of unmarried couples without discrimination.
1266	We now proceed to the vote.
1267	Sport these days - and this needs to be said - is closely bound up with other economic sectors, such as the audiovisual sector or the sector of the promotion and sale of sporting products, for example.
1268	What we need is an intelligent and flexible way of interpreting the present rules.
1269	In other words, to put it plainly, it is the consequence of an attack on democracy, however hard we try to avoid seeing it in this light.
1270	The Commission is therefore expecting to receive shortly a reply to its request for detailed information on the measures planned by the UK government.
1271	The proposal was put forward by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in a pre-budget statement made six months before the full budget statement made in the spring of 2001.
1272	Again, I thought that what Mr Simpson said was extremely helpful in reassuring us about the probable intentions of the UK government.
1273	Not only is a lot of time lost and high costs incurred through congestion, but it is quite a major problem for the environment in particular, and I therefore believe that, if the British government is actually investing money in solving the problems, then we all have something to gain, particularly all European citizens.
1274	We are more or less the only oil producers in the European Union and yet we face the highest petrol prices, the highest diesel prices of any country in Europe - GBP 1.20 a litre for diesel is paid in the United Kingdom.
1275	That concludes this item.
1276	The European Parliament has a duty to let them know that we stand with them, and so I propose, once again, that we observe a minute' s silence to express our solidarity and deep feeling.
1277	Madam President, I totally support this proposal since I was one of those who asked for this item to be entered.
1278	We made some good progress.
1279	The EU will deepen its relations with all major groups and will also contact the new US administration as soon as possible.
1280	Given the - surprise - glowing report by Mr Prescott on the deal which he had himself brokered, why was it that not only Madam Voynet but, I believe, and this is my last question to the Commissioner, most of the other environment ministers in Europe all rejected that?
1281	The fear is that the momentum has been lost and the American negotiators will change and we start afresh in May.
1282	The forests proved to be the major stumbling block this time round.
1283	If this global warming continues, then part of the territory of the EU Member States will become sea or desert.
1284	They have a high standard of living over there and the price of petroleum products is low.
1285	I compliment Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m on her efforts in The Hague and wish her more success.
1286	Without doubt, it was better to have no agreement at all than a poor one and it is true that, in this instance, the American proposal was a third-rate proposal, and one which was completely unacceptable to Europe.
1287	Climate change has a huge impact on the developing countries.
1288	Or, to put it another way: forests stop being carbon sinks and become carbon sources.
1289	Only if we have this credibility will the European Union be able to lead the debate and the action at COPÂ­VI "B" in Bonn.
1290	We will have to make our own assessment of what happened, and prepare the documents to make contacts with different parties, and of course with the "umbrella group" .
1291	Of course the follow up of the next COP6 or the continuation of COP6 will be to ratify an agreement inside the Union.
1292	Before the European Council, Pierre Moscovici and I will still be holding a Ministerial Conclave, next Sunday, to which I have invited Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, as well as a session of the IGC, on Monday at the General Affairs Council.
1293	The minimum number of participating Member States should be set at eight while the clause allowing appeal to the European Council, which currently constitutes a real right of veto, would be replaced by a power of retrieval.
1294	It may be regrettable, but I have to recognise the position.
1295	The European Council will also discuss the state of progress of the accession negotiations and hence of the enlargement.
1296	The Lisbon European Council approved guidelines designed to promote an innovative and competitive European economy.
1297	Consumer protection is an increasing concern for Europeans, for obvious reasons which I need not expand upon.
1298	We must be ready for this dramatic enlargement.
1299	When all is said and done, that is the criterion by which Nice must be judged.
1300	(Applause)
1301	One was that those candidate states themselves must adopt and implement the 'acquis communautaire'; that is their task shared with us.
1302	We are deeply attached to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and we do not want simply to declaim the Charter.
1303	It certainly could have been worded better, and, indeed, it can be honed and polished after Nice.
1304	I find it quite intolerable that several governments have simply brushed aside the question of including a reference to the Charter in Article 6 of the Treaty.
1305	You do not even intend to incorporate it into the Treaty, evidence indeed that this text, this exercise was always destined to be laid aside.
1306	We shall have to speak with just one disagreeable voice in the WTO.
1307	In view of the rather dim prospects of success, I do not think it would be a wise move to burden the Intergovernmental Conference with another complex and controversial topic.
1308	I would urge the French Presidency to do their utmost to overcome this divide, because it is extremely destructive.
1309	Regarding trade policy, the Commission has drawn up a proposal which must be carefully examined.
1310	Although the previous Treaty made some progress in extending the formula, it also brought in the crazy formula of codecision plus unanimity for citizenship, social security, the rights of the self-employed and also cultural policy.
1311	The very fact that this issue is being debated now is in itself a clear sign of the failure of a policy to strengthen ties of mutual trust between the countries that comprise the Union.
1312	This, quite simply, is the situation in which we have been stuck for months at the Intergovernmental Conference, because none of them are willing to give up their toys.
1313	The experience of this year has convinced us that, looking beyond Nice towards the future of Europe, the process of constitutionalising the Union must not be carried out by means of the - now dysfunctional - method of negotiations between government representatives.
1314	If majority voting does not become the general rule then decision-making will become irretrievably deadlocked, as Mr Prodi rightly commented a moment ago.
1315	" That aspect of subsidiarity has not been heard in our debate today but it is very important.
1316	We did so, the enlargement of 1995 went ahead, the discussion group presided over so well by Carlos Westendorp was created, Amsterdam arrived and now we are going to have Nice and practically nothing has changed, Mr President, we go round and round in circles on institutional issues and never find solutions which will allow us to cope with this hugely ambitious task of enlargement to 27 members.
1317	Let us not compound the disappointment which Nice will cause if it is unsuccessful by giving the people huge cause for disappointment in Parliament.
1318	We have demonstrated in the past that this goal is achievable and as someone from a Member State that has benefited from a planned transition to membership, I look forward in a positive way to an enlarged and peaceful Europe.
1319	But it has to be understood that if you have the right of veto then so does everyone else.
1320	But a first transition will also have to be made for the parliament to be elected in 2004 because at least some new Member States will come in before or during the Parliament to be elected in 2004 which will last until 2009.
1321	The President-in-Office of the Council addressed the issue of closer cooperation and said that we are on the way to reaching consensus on this matter.
1322	Mr President, on the face of it, the Nice Summit is all about making the necessary adaptations and dealing with the leftovers in the light of enlargement.
1323	If we could only take a leaf out of their book, i.e. put a little less emphasis on the things that are going wrong in our part of the world, and a little more emphasis on the things that are going well, then we would be a good deal happier than we are now.
1324	We should include not only trade in goods but also the corresponding trade in services, as well as investments, intellectual property and competition, in the range of matters which are subject to qualified-majority voting in the Council of Ministers and amend Article 133(1) of the Treaty accordingly.
1325	Granting the European Parliament a right of initiative in this highly sensitive domain would throw the door wide open to party-political despotism.
1326	So - as one of you said, referring to American optimism and the way Americans talk about themselves - we should also be capable of valuing what is working well and what is making progress.
1327	I would also say that I do not think there is a problem between 'larger and 'smaller' countries.
1328	We have done a great deal of work, but we have run up against the same old problem and I do not think a shift in a single country can start the ball rolling, because yet again we are faced with very tough national, political and democratic situations in twelve of the fifteen countries.
1329	To sum up, Mr VÃ©drine, you mentioned that the situation here appears to be too tense, and you also spoke of a certain pessimism.
1330	Will you also take steps generally to tighten security in appropriate ways so that there could be no recurrence.
1331	I believe that we must take action, which we certainly have not done to any extent hitherto, in order to ensure that the guests of Parliament can feel like guests in this House and that they need have no fear of being subjected to threatening behaviour.
1332	Hospitality over here and hospitality and respect over there.
1333	Thank you for your contribution, Mr Tajani.
1334	The best homage to Ernest Lluch and to his memory would be to respect his message - dÃ¬aleg in Catalan - can we all give this a chance in the Basque country?
1335	On the other hand of course, everyone can have their say.
1336	(B5-0550/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, to the Commission, on the political situation and humanitarian aid in Afghanistan.
1337	When I speak of organisation, I also mean that the European Union, which makes such strenuous efforts in this field, should be given a corresponding degree of responsibility.
1338	Secondly, you will note that the resolution affirms Parliament' s clear intention to place the security and defence policy squarely on two complementary pillars: civilian crisis management and, should that fail, military crisis management.
1339	. (FR) Mr President, given our late start and my commitments afterwards, I shall try to make the speech that I had prepared a little shorter.
1340	These relationships will, in particular, take the form of meetings between the North Atlantic Council and the iPSC and of meetings between the European Union and the fifteen European candidate and/or ally countries.
1341	If we take the events in the Balkans as an example, it can be said that everyone played their role to the full.
1342	During this period we have also kept the United States fully informed of developments in European security and defence policy, which is essential if this policy is to develop harmoniously, as is the case at the moment.
1343	The second edition of the European Union' s annual report on human rights has been presented to the European Parliament and a human rights forum will be held in Paris on 13 December.
1344	You claim that this policy does not aim to compete with the North Atlantic Alliance, which remains today the foundation of the collective defence of its members, or to establish a permanent European army.
1345	Furthermore, although I mentioned the figure of 100 000 soldiers, this does not mean that we are seeking to exceed the target set in Helsinki, but that we will have a reserve of qualified forces and forces with various areas of expertise, which will enable us to guarantee that the figure of 60 000 personnel in the Council' s target would be reached whatever operational conditions they may be required to work in.
1346	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to take a few words to describe the profound political significance, which has been approved by the majority of public opinion in our countries, of this new task that will provide Europe with a tool for political influence that it has, until now, lacked.
1347	We are now faced with the problem of ensuring that when we talk about consolidation of liberal democracy in Europe, we mean the whole of continental Europe, because that is what enlargement and the enlargement process is all about.
1348	We need to integrate three strands into a coherent whole, Community policies, CFSP, including ESDP, and national action by Member States.
1349	Even with our laborious procedures in the Commission, we do not need a force of 60,000 soldiers to accomplish our objectives.
1350	So it is extremely urgent to provide humanitarian aid.
1351	Although I do not agree with the cynics who say that it will provide Europe with a pointless toy, it is true that the rapid reaction force will not be immediately deployable in many situations.
1352	The EU ought not to develop its own defence involving permanent troops.
1353	Finally, I want to express my group' s considerable concern about the ever worsening situation in Afghanistan and urge the Commission and the Council to do all they can to increase their efforts to achieve a peaceful solution and to support the civilian population, especially now before the winter sets in.
1354	Quite simply: where, when and how is this European intervention force expected to take action in the future?
1355	It gives some idea of the terrible toll of these two months of intifada: 270 dead, most of them Palestinian, and nearly 10 000 wounded, many of them crippled for life.
1356	Hence his relentless efforts to build up an arsenal of extremely sinister weapons of mass destruction.
1357	Secondly, despite what the previous speaker said, I do not know whether it would be possible or desirable for the European Union to do any more than it is currently doing in relation to the conflict and escalation of violence which has taken place in the Middle East, especially now, when the United States is going through a transitional period.
1358	Mr President, I would like to focus in my speech on Mrs LalumiÃ¨re' s report, which I think is clearly worded and well put together.
1359	But there are no clear political objectives, and there is still effectively no common foreign and security policy.
1360	The EU has only one problem in this domain, namely the fact that it has yet to arouse public interest in this sort of action, even though such measures are considerably more sustainable and effective than military intervention.
1361	Mr President, then there is the budget, of course, and the question as to how it should be apportioned.
1362	I say this in spite of the mass of apparent reassurances on this subject that have miraculously been generated in the past few days.
1363	At the moment we are grossly short of that capability and ultimately Member States have to consider their defence expenditure plans, which are dramatically different from one country to another.
1364	Even those who speculate as to the benefits of certain decisions, such as the decision to create a so-called Euro-army, cannot fail to see the important political dimension of this decision and its effect on the cohesion of the European Union.
1365	The first attendance in our Parliament of a Minister of Defence is such an historic event that we have reserved the evening sitting for it so that our Members are not overwhelmed by the experience.
1366	In all of these, preventive civil crisis management is a better approach than the military option.
1367	Does Russia, in the long term, want to be in political union with a non-democratic rÃ©gime?
1368	So Europe is not about to form a new alliance as some people, who are not, I believe, fully informed, have suggested.
1369	Pursuant to Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received a motion for a resolution to end this debate.
1370	Given the scale of the task, four committees were involved and a hitherto unknown procedure was applied, in the form of four parallel reports.
1371	The package of measures proposed in the White Paper must help modernise the whole way the Commission functions and make it more efficient.
1372	So the reform must provide an opportunity to restrict their intervention solely to areas where no expenditure is involved.
1373	The differences of view that emerged are not just political but more a reflection of the cultural differences between the Fifteen.
1374	The main task of the new internal auditing service, under your direct responsibility, Mr Kinnock, Vice-President with responsibility for reform, will be to analyse the functions and systems of internal control which exist within the Commission.
1375	It has been a pleasure to work together and I think the process of addressing a crucial reform of the Commission that is central to the future of the European Union has had added depth and richness because the four of us have been involved.
1376	They may expect to move to other European institutions, to be seconded to national governments, or to work in the private sector.
1377	Accordingly, our committee repeats its attachment to a strong, independent, effective, transparent and politically answerable Commission.
1378	As the Committee on Budgets we consider that the establishment of the budget by activities causes us problems because of the lack of visibility of expenditure and our desire to strengthen the powers of the European Parliament as a budgetary authority.
1379	This would clearly indicate this Parliament' s goodwill in relation to moving ahead with this reform with the Commission.
1380	Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank the four rapporteurs for their excellent work.
1381	That is a shameful state of affairs when we consider that the EU itself is a champion of modernised business practice.
1382	Mr President, despite the effort made by the rapporteurs to support the Commission's work, the fact remains that a coherent, global response aimed at producing a governing policy in addition to merely improving the institution's administration system has not yet been given to the recommendations of the Committee of Independent Experts.
1383	This change of attitude should find expression in openness of government.
1384	As I see it, there is no structure of greater importance or substance in the world: 15 nations, soon to become 20 or more, an entire continent; the most industrialised part of the globe thrives in the Union and, therefore, in the Commission through its structures.
1385	Change is never easy.
1386	However, while doing so, the Socialist Group considers that the current functioning of the Community' s public administration is reasonably efficient.
1387	We are all familiar with the consequences of this situation and it has tested the dedication and skill of the many people working in the Commission and in its administration.
1388	Many thousands of project applications have been awaiting assessment for over a year now.
1389	The debate, as we have seen, is not so much about the principles, objectives and timeliness of the reform as about the procedures, pace, timetable, and possible shortcomings or unwanted consequences of its implementation.
1390	I would like to begin by reporting to the House that this morning's meeting of the College as Mr Van Hulten said earlier, adopted a proposal for an interinstitutional agreement establishing an advisory group on standards in public life, as outlined in Action 1 of the White Paper action programme.
1391	I think Mr Van Hulten made the point in the course of the debate again.
1392	The main aims of the new version are simplification, greater transparency and reinforcement of budgetary principles; in concrete terms, this means fewer exceptions to the rules, fewer incomprehensible special regimes and more efficient and effective budgetary procedures.
1393	For one thing, it is simply very uneconomical for the Commission if contracts operate in such a way that 20% of expenditure on item X is reimbursable, while 30% of expenditure on item Y is eligible for reimbursement, not to mention the frequent need for vouchers covering minimal items of expenditure to be collected and checked.
1394	The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0337/2000) by Mrs Sauquillo PÃ©rez del Arco, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the effectiveness of relations between the European Union and the developing countries and the impact of reform of the Commission on these relations [2000/2051(INI)].
1395	These latter aspects particularly effect the NGOs.
1396	Of course this is not enough, but it should at least protect us from caricatures about our poor record of development aid.
1397	We will come back to that later because that in itself constitutes a sound framework.
1398	Mr President, I have today returned from Mozambique where the European Union has been responsible for brilliant humanitarian assistance following the flood disaster, but, once again reconstruction projects, where we have already allocated the money, are delayed while signatures in Brussels are awaited.
1399	Given this situation, there is an inescapable need for greater involvement and greater effectiveness in the fight against poverty and underdevelopment.
1400	We now have a harmonised scheme to draft country strategy papers and indicative cooperation programmes in all developing countries.
1401	Moreover the creation of SEM provided no solution to the continuing mismatch between 8 voluminous administrative resources.
1402	Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I was especially keen to be with you today for the debate in the European Parliament on the first maritime package because you are about to examine three important texts which are a vital step in an issue which recent events have unfortunately made into headline news.
1403	This may also enable the Council Presidency to have discussions with the Member States with a view to obtaining the Council' s approval of your proposals and to adopting the text at first reading, if necessary by qualified majority voting.
1404	This swift and focused approach resulting in the two 'Erika' packages and six proposals has created an enormous momentum.
1405	The lesson for this Parliament this morning must be that we have to conclude that maritime laws throughout the world are in a state of shambles and we have to begin the process of putting them right.
1406	There must be a clear signal to sub-standard ships that we will not tolerate them in European waters or in European ports.
1407	For small tankers, we have adopted a compromise position between the 5000-tonne limit set by the ÃÃÃ and the 600-tonne limit set by the Commission.
1408	This information must be made available to the European, State and port authorities, and to interested members of the public.
1409	The transboundary nature of the marine environment, which means that pollution in one area can impact on a wider region, leads to the need for a Community-wide framework for cooperation in the field of accidental marine pollution.
1410	Nature protection organisations are also included in cooperation at local level.
1411	Amending the directive in terms of greater stringency in its application and the harmonisation of legislation, especially regarding the selection of ships for inspection and the scope of the different types of selection is clearly a positive step.
1412	I should like to reiterate that the urgent action upon which you are now insisting is not necessary.
1413	I believe that some rethinking will certainly have to be done between the Council and Parliament on the liability limit for classification societies, irrespective of what is decided today.
1414	A black box, a blacklist: we are in complete agreement with all these things, but there are still a few points I would like to bring to your attention.
1415	Faced with the disastrous and anarchic situation in maritime transport, Europe has taken up the challenge and, just 11 months after the loss of the Erika, will be in a position to announce that never has a procedure been worked out quite as quickly.
1416	In measurable terms, the liberal rationale is effectively opposed to a high level of maritime safety.
1417	Irrespective of the technical measures that will be adopted, one of the major reasons for this lack of safety will remain as long as the exponential growth in traffic linked to the overdevelopment of the North Sea ports is not balanced in the Channel and North Atlantic areas.
1418	It would be to the credit of the acting President-in-Office of the Council if he were to set things right in his own country too.
1419	Mr President, since the breaking up of the tanker Erika, a package of measures has been devised, under political pressure, with a view to improving the safety of ships at sea.
1420	Mr Gayssot, Greek ships have sunk without warning, when there were no storms in the vicinity.
1421	Thirdly, when we discuss dossiers of this kind, I think it becomes clear that we do not make the connection between our oil supply, on the one hand, and the fact that we are still using fossil fuels on the other.
1422	Let us have the political courage of our ecological ambitions.
1423	This shows that, in this area more than any other, we have a tremendous responsibility and we must, it seems to me, stifle any institutional pride we may have.
1424	For example, for Finland it is vitally important that Russia is included in these agreements.
1425	That applies both to the stricter requirements on the design of oil tankers, better rules on port state control and the tightening up of the rules on classification societies that will also result from this.
1426	Mr President, today we are discussing maritime safety on the basis of three reports, on which I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs warmly on.
1427	With regard to these three new proposals on maritime safety, I can only congratulate the three rapporteurs, who in a very short time have shown how determined our Parliament is to adopt new measures to enhance safety at sea, controls and construction standards, and that it is no longer tolerable that similar incidents should occur again.
1428	Mrs Chairman, a series of high-profile ship disasters, particularly involving oil tankers, has hit our continent in the recent past.
1429	More than 80 of accidents are associated with human error, but there are reasons for human error, which are social in nature.
1430	One Member of Parliament used the term 'traceability' .
1431	The port state control Directive is designed to check compliance with international requirements and not to introduce new rules.
1432	Amendment No 18 introduces port state control in relation to the seafarers' rest period, however the enforcement of the provisions in respect of seafarers' hours of work is already fully covered by existing Directive 99/95.
1433	I am happy to see that the rapporteur has introduced a reference in Amendment No 21 to the condition assessment scheme and we agree with the main thrust of the approach suggested but there is need for some fine tuning of the wording to make it clearer.
1434	Amendment No 4 and part of Amendment No 18 relating to point "K" are not acceptable.
1435	I can assure you that if a shipowner thinks of registering a ship on these registers, he should think twice after our proposal.
1436	The Commissioner spoke for 18 minutes and during this time she cited dozens and dozens of items and gave a breakdown of the position of the Commission.
1437	Proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision concerning a set of actions relating to the trans-European network for the collection, production and dissemination of statistics on the trading of goods within the Community and between the Community and non-member countries (Edicom) [COM(2000) 458 - C5Â­0401/2000 - 2000/0201(COD)] (Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs)
1438	While withdrawing the resolution, however, I express the conviction that this Parliament would have made its voice heard better if, in anticipation of the Council of Nice, it had devoted a specific and separate resolution to these important and difficult topics of the Intergovernmental Conference, instead of dealing with them in a single resolution that also embraces all the other points on the Council agenda.
1439	(Since more than 12 Members of Parliament stood up, the oral amendment was not retained) (Parliament adopted the resolution)
1440	Report (A5-0337/2000) by Mrs Sauquillo PÃ©rez del Arco, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the effectiveness of relations between the European Union and the developing countries and the impact of reform of the Commission on these relations [2000/2051(INI)]
1441	I voted against in protest at the fact that the European Union is still not managing to intervene in this matter as it should.
1442	Although the proposal to amend the current Directive on ship inspections and the Watts report fall far short of what is actually required, they are a step in the right direction and the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece have therefore voted in favour of the report.
1443	One can therefore deplore the fact that the Commission proposal has not taken up the idea of the establishment of a European surveillance body on the model of the coastguards in the United States.
1444	. (EL) We will not achieve safety at sea or protect human life at sea and the environment unless we address the unaccountability of shipowners, introduce strict controls on the state of ships, impose heavy penalties on shipping companies in breach of safety regulations, improve working times for seamen, train them properly and ensure that ships are crewed in keeping with their enhanced requirements.
1445	Unfortunately, rapporteur Hatzidakis has done the opposite.
1446	The loss of the Erika, which occurred in December 1999, put the issue of maritime safety on the Community' s political agenda and it was due to pressure from the European Parliament that the European Commission proposed the texts we voted on today, almost a year after the accident.
1447	Current compensation funds have been inadequately funded and this was all too apparent in the case of the Braer disaster where the Shetland Islands fishing industry was inadequately compensated for its losses.
1448	Madam President, I have already mentioned that I have been to sea in the past.
1449	The rapporteur' s proposals aimed at harmonisation on a European scale can only be positive.
1450	It is an important section as it relates to classification societies.
1451	Rather, it would be a great success, as the Europe we need on the eve of enlargement is not a supranational Europe which is inflexible, hierarchical and remote, but a Europe which is flexible and close to its people, therefore founded in respect for national democracies.
1452	The increasingly open struggle for power between many Member States is clouding the view in terms of possible compromises.
1453	The most important task in Nice is to ensure that the EU has effective institutions.
1454	Just one week away from the Nice Summit I personally have high hopes.
1455	Neither am I in favour of an automatic linking between QMV and codecision and once again believe that any decision to extend the powers of codecision should also be made on a case-by-case basis.
1456	By amending Article 133 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, Europe would extend the qualified majority voting currently in force in the Council in trade matters to other areas such as public services, intellectual property, health and education.
1457	Thus Parliament waives its right to influence, shuts its mouth and remains silent for the sake of party, State and government loyalties, forgetting its obligations to the people.
1458	I also voted against a text which calls for the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the eventual Treaty of Nice.
1459	It is a mistake to divide the union up into an A-team and a B-team, and I therefore cannot support a third of the Member States being given precedence.
1460	His new role has put an end to the traditional neutrality of Ireland, Sweden, Finland and Austria.
1461	. There is much that the British Conservative group can support in this report, in particular the emphasis on enlargement of the Union.
1462	- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have supported the report on setting up a common European security and defence policy.
1463	It is also, however, directed against the people of the European Union who will, in any event, have to finance the new expenditure on armaments which the report advocates and who will not even have a guarantee that these military forces will not one day be turned against themselves for the sake of 'maintaining law and order' .
1464	Equally serious is the intention that any State that does not wish to take part in a mission should be required to pay a financial contribution to be divided up among the States participating in that war.
1465	It is no good trying to impose a solution from outside using military methods, because it does not tackle the root cause of the conflict or change public opinion.
1466	Â· That military operations should be funded from a Community budget line and that Member States would have to contribute funds to operations even if they did not wish to participate (Paragraphs 49 and 50).
1467	However, it would be to the EU' s credit if the priorities of the Petersberg tasks were turned around and the focus placed upon model solutions of a civil and humanitarian nature.
1468	. I support this report from my colleague Maj-Britt Theorin.
1469	But the needs of this category of employers are only brought up in order to call for the introduction of measures to make 'domestic services tax-deductible' and to adjust 'prices and costs to take account of individuals' financial resources' .
1470	It is actually incredible that, in the twenty-first century, we should still be recommending that Member States guarantee the right of domestic staff to social security cover and adequate pensions.
1471	Too many young people are at risk of their first contact with the labour market being a job in the black economy.
1472	The very worst situation is when the women concerned also come from distant countries, having taken the work on out of desperation because they have no other way of continuing to provide for themselves.
1473	The Commission reform will be judged on actual evidence, hence the need for regular follow-up reports, which the European Commission will present throughout the programme, and the importance of the overall report, which is expected in December 2002.
1474	. (FR) In the still recent past, various scandals and inefficiencies resulted in the resignation of the European Commission in March 1999.
1475	In conclusion, I feel bound to say that we expect this reform, which is essential for the future, to introduce greater discipline and greater transparency into the day-to-day running of the Commission, but it must also lead to a greater sense of accountability on its part, within the strict framework of the competences that have been devolved to it.
1476	Conservatives also support the statement in Paragraph 7 of the report that democratic control be ensured and that the three pillar system be enabled to work.
1477	(The sitting was closed at 1.15 p.m.)
1478	Our information - and I wish to add straight away that I really cannot believe it - is that the President-in-Office of the Council, the President of France, will only be present tomorrow for 30 minutes in order to speak.
1479	There seems no possibility of our having a well-thought-through and properly argued position.
1480	Whatever the case, let us have a vote on it, and, personally, I support a resolution along the lines suggested by Mr Poettering, Mr Lannoye and others.
1481	They continued working on these texts during the night, just as they continued working through the night on figures relating to the division of votes in the Council and of seats in Parliament.
1482	Madam President, I would strongly urge the case for not removing this report by Mr de Roo from the agenda, as it has been excellently prepared, and we will be preparing to adopt a common position on it next Monday and Tuesday in the final Environment Council of the French Presidency.
1483	Thank you, Mr Parish.
1484	In the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy - as Chair of that committee - he sits there smoking.
1485	The political basis is clear: harmonisation of the market whilst maintaining a high standard of public health and consumer protection, and building on existing legislation and advanced scientific knowledge.
1486	Their way and concept of life, in which the protection of health is becoming increasingly important, are at stake.
1487	This rule can be applied equally to all recreational but dangerous drugs when no one but the person consuming the drug is likely to be affected.
1488	Cases have recently been won in the United States against the tobacco multinationals for poisoning people and lying about the toxicity of their products.
1489	As regards export from the European Union of cigarettes that are banned within the Union for health reasons, we consider that the only reasonable and consistent solution is to put a stop to this.
1490	Rather than learn the lessons of the defeat suffered in Luxembourg on 9 October, we persist in taking a legally indefensible attitude.
1491	I have studied carefully what the Commissioner said to my colleague Mr Hume: "No massive job losses in this sector.
1492	It is Parliament and the Council who have to approve this proposal for a directive and examine, amongst other things, a suitable legal basis for it.
1493	I do not believe we can take such a restrictive route, that is to say, independently of the content - and the substantial content which has been highlighted by Mr Maaten and others - that there is a danger that, if this Parliament and the Council accept the restrictive interpretation proposed by the leader of the European People' s Party and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, this Parliament, the Council and the Community institutions as a whole would be tying their hands and feet with regard to the legislative development of the Community institutions, which is so important to the development of Community law.
1494	The weakness of the proposal resides in the fact that it places heavy emphasis on the promotion of free competition.
1495	In conclusion, since the Treaty of Amsterdam the European Parliament has the power of coordination over environmental and consumer protection matters, and it will, of course, work closely with the Council and the Commission in this regard.
1496	In fact, it does not actually have anything to do with tobacco: the European Court of Justice's judgment might just as well have been handed down in relation to an advertising ban on alcohol, for example, or an advertising ban on chocolate, because we know that sugar can also be damaging to human health.
1497	I simply do not understand why a majority here in Parliament want to propose more lenient rules for exports than those proposed by the Member States' own governments - the governments which, however, also represent the many industries referred to.
1498	It is a fact that 80% of smokers want to stop but there are few policies within the tobacco industry to help those people stop.
1499	If we insist on telling other countries what health standards they should set by extending our sensible proposals for the domestic market to exports, we shall put all Mr Maaten's good work at risk.
1500	We are in favour of devising a standardised testing method recognised by all EU Member States, to be implemented by an approved testing laboratory.
1501	The health effects of tobacco use are now widely recognised and there is a shared feeling among legislators and the public alike that the time has come to adopt stringent rules and regulations on this product.
1502	Consequently, the Community rules will fit well into the future international arrangements, avoiding the danger of trade barriers and reinforcing, at the same time, the protection of consumers and ensuring a high level of health.
1503	It would be preferable to wait until the overall question of additives is dealt with in the first Commission report.
1504	On laboratory tests, the amendment dealing with approval of tests is superfluous as another article provides for circulation of goods that are in accordance with the provisions of the directive.
1505	Madam President, this report is very straightforward: at present, directives on summer time only last for five years, and then have to come back to Parliament to be renewed.
1506	Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive on summer time arrangements that we are examining today is a good proposal.
1507	I do not therefore think that we should dwell on this matter for too long in this House; after all the Member States and also the public have already accepted the summer time arrangements to a large extent and they are acknowledged to be part of our calendar.
1508	It is to be welcomed that the proposal states that matters connected with time zones and summer time provisions should be matters for Member States to decide.
1509	It would be reasonable to end summer time at the end of September, approximately six months after it starts.
1510	It can agree to make appropriate proposals on the basis of the conclusions of the report of 2007 referred to in Article 5.
1511	There is clarification that interventions in the human germ line cannot be accepted.
1512	If we accept it we will still have a directive which guarantees therapeutic progress and which does not just leave the protection of patients in Europe as it is but improves it, and that is why I would plead in favour of this compromise.
1513	These groups must remain within the scope of the directive.
1514	I am also pleased, however, that we have succeeded in clamping down on germ-line gene therapy.
1515	I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Liese, on his report and thank him for his efforts to reach a compromise.
1516	They include the action plan to combat cancer, the programme of action for the prevention of AIDS, the programme of action for the prevention of drug dependence and the action plan to promote health and, if they are suspended, it will mean an end to the projects and the work being carried out by the networks which have been set up.
1517	What a good idea to be able to prepare the way, to proceed as far down the line as possible, to be so close that, even if we need a second reading, we are already within a hair's breadth of a decision.
1518	Furthermore, we must take account of the fact that prevention and promotion as well as monitoring are all going to be increasingly important and therefore they should be given more resources and a higher profile.
1519	Madam President, subsequent to the Trakatellis report on the extension of the existing European public health programmes, I wish to express my concern at the direction in which European policy in the field of public health is developing.
1520	I understand that the Council has also signalled its agreement in principle.
1521	In the European Union, there is currently the paradox that the abolition of internal borders for the free movement of goods, people, services and capital has to live side by side with the maintenance of 15 national borders in the fields of police and criminal justice, which the Member States are making difficult to remove.
1522	Finally, the initiative is an important step forward in the creation of a European legal area, albeit partial and limited, but it responds to the real needs of an enormous number of European citizens who, until now, have been largely unprotected on becoming victims of crime outside their usual country of residence.
1523	What did we request for this group of people?
1524	At the same time, special training should be provided for the professionals whose task it is to come into direct contact with victims.
1525	Victims must not be victims twice over, first of crime, and subsequently of the system.
1526	It is also important in this context, for the next of kin, i.e. the family of the victim, to be apprised of the facts in a discreet and professional manner, should they so wish, and for them to be able to rely on receiving the necessary support and not have to learn everything from the press.
1527	This is the case irrespective of the type of crime committed.
1528	We must never stray from the basic principle that individuals must always take responsibility for their own actions, either at the level of the Member State or at EU level.
1529	In other cases, it might be possible to get the information needed in a language of the Union which is not their own.
1530	I am delighted by the favourable response shown by Parliament to this first text on such an important subject, so that the area of freedom, security and justice which we are gradually building may offer our fellow citizens support in situations that are often difficult to live with.
1531	Vote on a request for urgent procedure
1532	(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)
1533	So we agreed with the Council during the night of 23 to 24 November on the main points of what is a perfectly reasonable, although by no means brilliant budget.
1534	The Commission therefore suggested revising the figures by EUR 300 million.
1535	However, I also know from the discussions that it is far more difficult to formulate a negotiable Council position, obtain a mandate and accommodate pure national chauvinism in a fairly reasonable and tenable overall European decision.
1536	I hope that work will progress on a European recruitment agency - or "joint recruitment office" as we call it in our very best German - so that we can jointly overcome the problems which all the institutions - the Council, the Commission, Parliament and the other institutions - will face over coming years, i.e. the problem of staffing over coming years.
1537	The Council refuses to carry out this revision - it seems that now we should have the information - and I want to warn you: using the flexibility instrument two years in a row, two consecutive years, in fact, in less than fifteen months, and the first time less than six months after the adoption of the perspective, is financially draining the flexibility instrument because it prevents it from being replaced and from possible accumulation, which is planned for up to 600 million.
1538	This very considerable amount, which matches the heavy requirements for 2001, will be largely funded by mobilising the flexibility instrument for an amount of EUR 200 million.
1539	When the Council voted at second reading for a budget increase of 2.5%, it took due account of this new factor.
1540	Lastly, before you proceed to the final adoption of this budget, I wish to stress the importance the Council attaches to some of the fundamental budgetary rules, in the field of entering appropriations in the reserve, the legal basis and the classification of expenditure.
1541	Unlike Nice, all three institutions - the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission - are, I think, well pleased with the final result.
1542	Ladies and gentlemen, with the new outbreak of BSE in cattle, immediate action was also required in the budgetary area in order to protect health and consumers and help the farmers affected.
1543	Furthermore, the Council has defined a multiannual sum, admittedly indicative in nature, which is compatible with this financial perspective, for the framework programme for aid for reconstruction in the Western Balkans.
1544	We fought tooth and nail to add a few extra million euro.
1545	I would like to thank Mrs Haug most sincerely.
1546	They will therefore think that this 1% of the European Union budget is being very well used.
1547	You said, if I understood you correctly, that we should not be using the reserve because it was against the rules to do this.
1548	So I think that, along with much else which there is too little time to mention, we have a great deal to be pleased about.
1549	Although agricultural expenditure, which accounts for almost half the entire budget, will increase by more than 5%, when the Letter of Amendment has been taken into account, the overall increase in the budget is just 3.5%.
1550	It already looks likely that the huge risk of a clash between MEDA, Mediterranean rim projects and the Balkans will increase over the next few years, despite the fact that we all know that this is where money is urgently needed.
1551	We feel satisfied that we overcame the difficulties blocking the path towards the much sought-after aim of fulfilling the commitments that were given at Helsinki to the candidate countries without destroying the Union, of enabling tomorrow' s Europe to continue to function effectively.
1552	I am talking about real progress, even if it does not go as far as the presidency - which, I should point out, has shown great openness at national level - would have wished.
1553	A new legal basis has been laid down for the status of European political parties and Parliament has been given the status of institutional plaintiff laid down under Article 230 of the Treaty.
1554	In the last three weeks, progress has been made in three major areas.
1555	This is the purpose of the declaration adopted at Nice and of the study that has been commissioned to coordinate the fight against doping at European level.
1556	As everyone knows, another threat we face is global warming.
1557	Furthermore, at Nice, the European Union established the permanent bodies necessary to define and conduct a common foreign and security policy, which are: a political and security committee, a military committee and a European defence staff.
1558	The French Presidency thanks you, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, for this cooperation, for your support and also for the warm reception you have given us.
1559	(Applause)
1560	(Applause)
1561	Now we need to look at the text carefully in Parliament.
1562	I would like to point out, by the way, Mr President-in-Office of the European Council, that this is paid for by taxpayers.
1563	I consider it to be a failure not only in terms of the European Union' s stated ambition to change the institutions so that they are capable of properly receiving the new Member States by improving the European Union' s efficiency, but I also consider it to be a failure in terms of another important aim, which has perhaps not been sufficiently highlighted, which is the rapprochement of the European Union and its citizens.
1564	We feel that the right questions are those on the lips of the impressive human tide which converged on Nice from all over Europe on the eve of the Summit.
1565	First of all, the Fifteen signed the agreement on the sly and under the smokescreen created by the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
1566	(Applause)
1567	My group is disappointed by this Treaty and is worried about the future that it holds for us and we will therefore use all our power to oppose it.
1568	Mr President, I give you the floor.
1569	(Applause)
1570	Mr President, I should like to know if the European Parliament's jurisdiction for summer time has been newly acquired since Nice.
1571	As a result of the determination shown by both the Member States and Parliament, laboratories previously discouraged by the complexity of clinical trials will perhaps find the courage to develop the market for children' s medicines, even if it is not yet big enough to provide a return on the investment!
1572	Do we really have to carry on with the change to summer time? It was brought in at the time of the oil crises, to save energy and has been extended to 2001?
1573	The status of the victims in criminal proceedings is not always properly protected.
1574	Consequently, many travellers and holidaymakers will benefit from this European initiative.
1575	Mr President, it is my turn to salute the President of the Commission, who is here, and the Presidency of the Council, which is coming, and to underline that there has probably never been such unanimity expressed in this Parliament on the results of a summit.
1576	The one that works is the one that has after all, it seems to me, spent the six months getting the work done in six essential areas, under the leadership of the French Presidency.
1577	However, my greatest fear is that Britain, France and Germany will now be able to subvert the delicate balance developed between states of various sizes and between the institutions over several decades.
1578	It is hard to see what there is in the Nice decisions which really makes enlargement of the EU any the easier.
1579	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have little to say today.
1580	The only consequence which I can draw from all this is that, when it comes to voting on the Treaty of Nice, my vote will be a no vote.
1581	Mr President, the most important result from Nice was that, in spite of everything, there was a treaty, so that a place can now be prepared for the applicant States.
1582	The real winners in this Conference were Blair and Aznar, the Euro-sceptics.
1583	So let us forget about Nice now, and think about post-Nice -and you will forgive me if I pin my hopes on the plan for a grand convention advanced by Belgium for its Presidency, because the evidence is there, we must do something new, we must change the method, we must accelerate history: 2004 is too late, it is too far off, it is too dangerous.
1584	Instead, the spirit of Nice clearly amounted to wondering how to block, how to intergovernmentalise, how to be feted at home as the defender of national interests, rather than how to take the European Union forward.
1585	Amsterdam and Nice have given us a Europe of imperial rulers, a Europe of national administrations, not a Europe of political unification.
1586	We must introduce qualified majority decision-making for the essential topics, or else the situation will become untenable.
1587	It is true - I shall paraphrase Mr Bayrou - that I have been sitting here since this morning; first next to the President of the Republic, then by myself, and the criticism has struck me as moderate and friendly, but criticism all the same.
1588	We should not forget that this is actually the first time since 1957 that the grid has been genuinely reformed and revised.
1589	We operate under constitutional systems and the powers must not get confused.
1590	Thank you very much, Minister.
1591	But it has neither been incorporated into the Treaties, nor has a reference to the Charter been put in Paragraph 2 of Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union.
1592	Finally, there are a few positive things: the new version of Article 7 of the Treaty; the article on political parties and their statute; the right of this Parliament to take the other institutions to the Court of Justice - that is also an important factor of political control; the new formula for the European Commission, putting the so-called "lex Prodi" into the Treaty, strengthening the President and the new composition of the Commission - a reasonable compromise which I accept and will work over time; and, as my colleague, Mr Tsatsos pointed out, the way forward to the future.
1593	Mr President, we have already made a thorough assessment of what happened in Nice, but we should remember that Nice began with a very restricted agenda.
1594	Let us take one thing at a time: the charter was not included in the Treaty, not so much as a mention.
1595	We want to prove to the heads of government that we know best.
1596	Notwithstanding all the self-congratulation by the French government this morning, the IGC simply did not finish on a good note.
1597	Mr President, it is not easy to criticise the French presidency during this debate as it is not present.
1598	Mr President, the Nice Summit has shown that Intergovernmental Conferences have reached the end of their useful life.
1599	2001 budget (continuation)
1600	However, this does not mean that we could have done more or better.
1601	These maximum levels force the Commission to set priorities within the confines of a budget, in the way that every government has to.
1602	The vote that is to follow this debate will mark the end of the long, complex process of approving the European Union budget for 2001.
1603	That is what we have done: we have avoided a budgetary crisis by going to Article 272; the financial perspective has been maintained, even though we have used the flexibility instrument.
1604	Let me just say to the Council that, as far as this game is concerned, we have not run out of balls and this side intends playing until we get the right result.
1605	We do not want there to be a proposal for revision for next year in the Colom Resolution, because we want to wait for the World Bank evaluation, but we share his criticism that this method of resolving the financial insufficiency in category 4 distorts the multiannual nature of the major external objectives of the Union and the very definition of the financial perspective.
1606	For all this to be possible, there will have to be extensive prioritising in the future, too.
1607	That is the only right and the only sensible way of investing the money at our disposal on behalf of our fellow citizens.
1608	If we include the expected supplementary budget, it comes out at nearly 8%, while other areas, such as training policy, the whole of internal policy - including research -, foreign policy, administration and accession aid have together only risen by 1.1%.
1609	And we shall have the opportunity of continuing this excellent cooperation on the supplementary budget in January.
1610	It also behoves us to criticise the relations between Russia and the Baltic States, which are still to be regularised.
1611	We will follow the developments in Russian society and internal politics with great interest.
1612	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the common strategy towards the Russian Federation was the first common strategy in the history of the European Union.
1613	Even if President Putin guarantees the democratic development of his country, that does not automatically guarantee a stable and democratic Russian Federation.
1614	Slyness does not become us: we must build a Europe of economic cooperation.
1615	Mr Van Orden is quite right in what he says regarding the Caucasus.
1616	Anyone looking at Russia from the outside and with the odd personal experience from visiting the country itself and speaking to Russian counterparts will soon be in danger of selectively tailoring reality in the Russian Federation to fit his personal image.
1617	In the political sector, the common strategy towards the Russian Federation proposes entering into a standing dialogue on policy and security and creating a permanent mechanism for such dialogue.
1618	I should here like to highlight the value of our really emphasising the seriousness of Russia' s in actual fact being in a political union with Belarus.
1619	Do you intend to support a project such as this, Commissioner Patten?
1620	In this context, as Parliament will know, at the last summit between the European Union and Russia, Romano Prodi launched a far-reaching dialogue on energy.
1621	I very much hope to visit Kaliningrad myself in the early part of next year, and not just because Immanuel Kant spent the whole of his life there.
1622	I congratulate the honourable gentleman once again on an extremely good report on a very important issue, to which I am sure we will return in this Parliament over the next few years again and again.
1623	You are placing me in a very difficult position.
1624	Mr President, this debate is already overdue because the BSE crisis has huge implications for feedingstuffs, both home-grown and imported.
1625	The Council has expressed its concern at many meetings with Russia at all levels, particularly seeking to induce Russia to avoid the excessive use of force and to avoid any extension of the conflict, to carry out independent and efficient inquiries into human rights violations, to support the OSCE Assistance Group in fulfilling its mission and, finally, to ensure that humanitarian aid is distributed properly.
1626	Mr President, a point of order: it is standard practice in the House for questions which cannot be adequately answered orally to be submitted in writing.
1627	(Interruption by Mr Posselt)
1628	This directive dates from 1992.
1629	This is what we should be striving for.
1630	These groups are obviously not excluded under the new proposal.
1631	The Presidency and a number of Member States have already received various letters from the ComitÃ© europÃ©en des fabricants de sucre (European Committee of Sugar Manufacturers) regarding the Commission' s proposals, which they will take into account in their deliberations.
1632	Question No 6 by (H-0886/00):
1633	First of all I have to say that, in my opinion, the President-in-Office of the Council has not yet answered Mr Korakas' question.
1634	This authority must now be set up, and I think the European authorities have now become very aware of the issue, and that we must forge ahead.
1635	Has the Presidency representative, in this instance the French Ambassador to Algeria, actually met Mr Ahmed Taleb?
1636	We welcome the arrangements proposed in this respect by the Preparatory Committee and adopted by the General Assembly regarding procedures for the registration of non-governmental organisations for involvement in the preparatory process and the Special Session in September 2001.
1637	The partnership agreement contains a number of references to the European Convention on Human Rights.
1638	. (FR) As the Council has emphasised to the honourable Member in the previous answer, the process of the mutual recognition of judgements will afford better protection of individuals' rights.
1639	I would like to press him further.
1640	In particular, it provides the political scrutiny and strategic administration of a military crisis management operation.
1641	I should just like to point out that the Treaty system differentiates between taxes and indirect taxes which must be harmonised in order to ensure the proper establishment and smooth running of the internal market - according to Article 93 - and the approximation, laid down in Article 94, of legislation which has a direct bearing on the establishment or running of the common market, including legislation on direct taxation.
1642	Allow me briefly to summarise these three main sectors.
1643	If this pattern of behaviour continues, where in case of doubt each party fights the other, it could break up the Stability Pact for South-East Europe, which is based on regional cooperation.
1644	In the end we also need cooperation with Yugoslavia, meaning cooperation on both sides.
1645	Mr President, our Group supports the work done by Mr Baltas on the report on the feasibility of negotiating stabilisation and association agreements with the Republic of Croatia.
1646	Mr President, during the years when I was President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, I had the opportunity to support many Croatians in their efforts towards the freedom and prosperity that they, like other peoples on our continent, identified with their integration into the European institutions.
1647	I have to say that, on the basis of Croatia's performance this year, I have every confidence that we will be able to set a brisk pace.
1648	That is certainly our approach, and the speed with which we have adjusted our policy towards Croatia in recent months testifies to that.
1649	We owe it to Croatia to give the government and people of Croatia every help in the years ahead and we are extremely grateful to the honourable Member for his wise advice in ensuring that we pursue this route.
1650	It is incomprehensible, in this respect, that the Laskar Jihad was given the chance this spring to go to the Moluccas in their thousands, in order to stoke up the conflicts there again.
1651	In Timor, the militias block the return of the refugees and relief workers are besieged.
1652	On behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I will restrict what I have to say to three points.
1653	Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Maij-Weggen on the excellent job she has done.
1654	The country is not unique in that respect.
1655	Ongoing violence on the Moluccas, in Aceh and in Irian Jaya is causing great suffering among the people.
1656	Here, tomorrow, we shall have the presentation of the Sakharov Prize.
1657	However, following the latest reports from the Indonesian archipelago, we are compelled to ask whether the situation does not in fact look more serious, more precarious still for President Wahid and his brothers-in-arms, than the report would suggest.
1658	If we want to help Indonesia we must act now with money and deeds, not merely words.
1659	I think the report is extremely valuable in shedding light on what has been happening.
1660	It is clear that Indonesia's difficulties will not be solved overnight.
1661	Protection of Communities' financial interests
1662	We must finally remove the obstacles that prevent it from acting independently, especially with regard to recruiting staff and to its own structure.
1663	So the Commission must carry out internal reforms so as to finally make good its announcement that fraud will no longer be tolerated and that it will consistently follow up all cases of fraud.
1664	I think precisely that should be the end result, of Nice too.
1665	We welcome negotiations between the Member States concerning uniform legislation in the area of crime, but we shall not submit our countries to a federal EU prosecution authority.
1666	I should also like to know why the Commission's paper on this subject had its release delayed until the day after the Danish referendum on the euro.
1667	I put an amendment down to name these countries because it is about time they were named and shamed.
1668	Actually I am sure that it is also in OLAF's interest to make the selection of senior officials transparent.
1669	However, we must be careful within the European Parliament not to miss seeing the log in our own eye because we are concentrating so hard on the splinter in our neighbour's eye - the Commission.
1670	We are trying to extinguish a fire and are suffocating in the smoke.
1671	And no one can understand it, including myself.
1672	To achieve this aim fully, I shall highlight four requirements that I consider essential in the work of the budgetary control authority.
1673	As far as Parliament itself is concerned, the problem is the Treaty.
1674	It does make us rather apprehensive, Commissioner, to find that the Commission as Guardian of the Treaties has to be referred explicitly to the need to observe MEPs' rights.
1675	They concern a number of courses of action that the Budgetary Control Committee can take when it finds problems in different areas, including recommending to the Committee on Budgets to freeze or reduce the amount of appropriations intended for the headings concerned in the following year's budget; to authorise no transfers of appropriations to take place involving increasing the headings concerned for a certain period until further internal investigations are concluded; up to asking the President of the Commission to ask for the resignation of any individual Commissioners concerned with the serious problems found, a kind of EU Caesarean.
1676	The report calls for detailed reviews of operational activities, thorough checks of budget headings and irregularities together with an assessment of the Commission's internal performance.
1677	Commissioner, the point of departure for forwarding information to the European Parliament is the EC Treaty and not the Interinstitutional Agreement.
1678	But unless the directive is amended, the end result of this common position would be that not only do we not have a level playing field with North America, we do not even have one within Europe.
1679	I really do not know why we should not eventually succeed in reaching a compromise in this case, as with all other directives.
1680	It is a proposal that has gone down a long and, I fear, stormy road in order to overcome some of the existing problems.
1681	The first amendment refers to Article 4, which establishes what will be the competent authority for supervising the bid.
1682	Now we have a proposition that would lead to muddle, forum shopping, potential litigation at a delicate moment in a corporate deal.
1683	In the UK the regulation of takeovers through the voluntary code of practice administered by the takeover panel has been highly successful: a good example here of a pragmatic approach to a highly complex issue where legislation will be less appropriate.
1684	But, more than that, the bigger prize is that we are able to take forward the Lisbon agenda of creating a competitive, dynamic European economy.
1685	Here in the European Parliament we are chiefly concerned with finding minimum European rules to regulate the major fields of tension in take-over law, for instance the boards against the shareholders, large shareholders against small ones, companies against the stock market.
1686	Some of the amendments proposed by Parliament further improve the text of the Council' s common position because they highlight points that could lead to interpretation difficulties and push for speedier transposition of the directive.
1687	After all, it is by no means certain that the proposed definition of equitable price is better than any other, because the various definitions that are currently in use in the Member States are all perfectly satisfactory.
1688	The debate is closed.
1689	Moreover, the artist is assigned a right of information so that he can make his claims to royalties known to a professional art dealer during a period of up to three years, which is reasonable since the dealer has to keep the accounts of his purchases and sales.
1690	Accordingly, this matter should be put before the Austrian legislator instead of attacking the European legislator who is only creating positive framework conditions for artists and auction houses.
1691	It is furthermore essential that we find a common position on the matter in hand, since this is the only way that the European Union will be able to carry any weight internationally and to defend the interests of creative artists worldwide.
1692	I put my trust in the wisdom and farsightedness of this House.
1693	In Germany, for example, in 1998, of 7 000 artists who transferred their rights, only 274 actually got any money from it and 40% of the droit de suite was taken up in costs in levying the sum.
1694	In short, there is no need for harmonisation of this sort in this area.
1695	A similar amendment was rejected at first reading.
1696	They thought the translations could be made available in spite of this fairly difficult and densely packed timetable.
1697	Unfortunately, however, we have now reached the point at which we can no longer defer this discussion.
1698	Our committee proposed that this be undertaken one year earlier.
1699	This Parliament is naturally on the side of these values and will continue to support them.
1700	Technology and changing markets will drive change, in any event.
1701	We cannot find any legal grounds for excluding competition from these other domains.
1702	A reduction of the universal service - the very core of the postal service sector - to 50 grammes would seriously put at risk the ability of the national postal operators to deliver a universal service at an affordable tariff to people, irrespective of where they live.
1703	I remind my Conservative MEP colleagues of the mess they got into in the UK when they tried to privatise the British post office.
1704	We have turned the safety net for post users into a hammock for those large postal companies where they can carry on doing what they are now getting away with.
1705	I am very pleased about that, because this notion of special services was in any case intended to exclude new technologies from the scope of universal service.
1706	We cannot, Madam President, Commissioner, and will not, tolerate such a situation.
1707	This is why the European Commission has not suggested liberalising all postal services as a second step in the process.
1708	It is this kind of future I would also like to see in the other countries within the European Union.
1709	In the Dutch newspapers, Mr Bolkestein recently criticised the French for adopting a non-liberal attitude, or, at least, that is how the headline in one of the newspapers read.
1710	Spain might be able to enlighten us on this matter, for it established the fund and has used it, and I would mention the uncertain legal bases of the fund, the virtual criteria used in its composition and the discretionary authorisation of its application.
1711	We are voting tomorrow, and I hope the amendments by Mr Atkins or Mr Sterckx will be adopted, otherwise I will have no choice but to vote against this report.
1712	The Royal Mail competes with other companies and delivers letters to me in MalmÃ¶ in Sweden.
1713	Madam President, Commissioner, what we have learned from the debate or, rather, the controversy created by Commissioner Bolkenstein in his quest to liberalise the postal services, undertaken in the absence of any assessment of the first phase and in contravention of the rules defined by this directive is that, under cover of progressive and status-enhancing terms such as modernisation, liberalisation and keeping pace with rapid technological developments, we are slipping into a situation in which the social quality of countries is declining.
1714	It is unlikely that the planned protection of the universal provision of services by means of a compensatory fund, as a result of which private profits are ploughed back into public services, will last.
1715	These limits and delays also contributed to a debate in which the ends are often confused with the means.
1716	Madam President, in dealing with this issue we are talking about economic and social cohesion.
1717	Madam President, firstly, please allow me to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, because his work has been complicated and difficult and he has had to try to find a balance between dramatically differing proposals, positions and points of departure and arrival.
1718	I fear that this will mean that the present monopolists can further strengthen their position on the back of the taxpayer and that the threshold for newcomers will be raised quite a bit.
1719	I am also glad to see that our continental Liberal friends are giving the lead to British Liberals.
1720	I certainly recognise that there is nothing wrong with the concept of liberalisation per se and that it can bring benefits to consumers.
1721	It was justified because it is in keeping with the logic of the founding Treaties of the European Union which prioritise the establishment of the internal market through the free movement of goods and services in a competitive environment.
1722	Universal service is the cornerstone of Community policy in this area and everything we do is designed to create a proper climate for its improvement.
1723	Special services are another very important area where innovation and modernisation must be encouraged.
1724	He said that between now and the end of the decade the opening to competition of virtually the whole postal market appears to be inevitable.
1725	I stand for cast-iron guarantees that universal service obligations will always be protected.
1726	That is why I cannot and will not be silent when the future of the sector is threatened by a failure to meet properly the challenges set to us all at Lisbon.
1727	Thank you very much, Mr Simpson.
1728	Well, I would remind you that the main objective of this common organisation of the market is to guarantee access to the Community market for these countries' products.
1729	It is therefore crucial to find, in addition to the EUR 300 rating preference, a means of permitting them effective access to quota 'C' and of making an ongoing assessment of the impact of the system on these producers.
1730	For example, we feel bound to express our concern about banana production in certain ACP countries, in the small producing countries of the Caribbean and in certain countries of Western Africa, which have traditionally been suppliers to the banana market and to whom we have commitments that we cannot ignore.
1731	I therefore ask the Members of this House to endorse this report in its entirety, as did the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
1732	Meanwhile, the US first condemns historical reference periods but now advocates its own historical reference periods.
1733	Powerful interests are at play, especially those of the Americans, who, although they are not banana-growers themselves, have invested American capital in the trading corporations.
1734	It sometimes seems as though the Commission, in its proposals on deregulation in international trade and agricultural production, has gone even further than the Cairns Group.
1735	It is a pity that the Commission and the Council still insist on a solution that may seriously jeopardise this production, particularly after 2006.
1736	Successive WTO rulings do not say that we cannot give preferential treatment to our traditional suppliers.
1737	Hence, the transitional period should be about fifteen years, certainly not less than ten, and the compensatory aid should include guaranteed earnings for Community producers and a market for the produce of the outermost regions, and so aid should also be included for the bodies that market the bananas produced there.
1738	I hope that it will listen to our arguments today, for this system proposed by the Commission, this tariff preference, even if it were to amount to EUR 300, is in danger of proving completely useless in practice, for the ACP producers will be wiped out by the so-called 'first come, first served' system.
1739	VOTE
1740	(Parliament approved the Commission proposal)
1741	The Commission rejects all the other amendments.
1742	Before the vote:
1743	(Parliament accepted the oral amendment)
1744	Report (A5-0376/2000) by Ms Morgan, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on reform of budgetary control procedures and institutions [2000/2008(INI)]
1745	Most smokers neither know the full risks nor bear the full costs of their choice.
1746	In my long parliamentary career, which has now spanned 35 years, I have always adhered to this principle.
1747	I fear they will hope in vain.
1748	This is our last-ditch attempt to put labels and pictures on cigarette packs which reflect the true cost of smoking.
1749	Lehne report (A5-0368/2000)
1750	This is a judgment that I still regard as relevant and correct, which is why I have voted against the report in its entirety.
1751	The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market rightly insists on no upper limit and a minimum of no less than 7%.
1752	By voting against this directive, my group would also like to give out a political signal that we should not waste our time laying down superfluous rules.
1753	If it is right to denounce the Stalinist dictatorship of the past, how is it possible to have the slightest confidence in Mr Putin, the executioner of the Chechen people, the godfather of the various mafias and the man who endeavours to eliminate all opposition in civil society (unions, political parties) in order to strengthen his personal power?
1754	Of course, Indonesia does not really deserve this development of closer relations with the Union because its leaders have not exactly distinguished themselves in terms of great democracy or commendable actions, but we must think about the Indonesian citizens, and so I say roll on the development of closer relations and I welcome the provision of this aid.
1755	The unit is only to be involved with criminality committed by EU employees.
1756	- (FR) The Theato report on combating fraud reveals that the Central European Bank, no doubt the better to prove its celebrated independence, thought it inappropriate to subscribe to the Interinstitutional Agreement relating to OLAF.
1757	That concludes the vote.
1758	Either we are in a club or we are out of it and it is particularly important that we accept this.
1759	Ladies and gentlemen, let us not have occasion to change the name.
1760	The fact is that the 'tariff only' system is an important factor which ensures that the Commission's proposal is well balanced and can serve as a basis for progress in the Council.
1761	Marketing schemes for these bananas are also part of national and regional rural-development programmes.
1762	Europe and the United States work closely together in defence of the values we share.
1763	We expect there to be discussion on a future new WTO round as well as some discussion of the implications for that round of the wide array of new bilateral trade initiatives being debated in the American hemisphere.
1764	He has rightly said that the transatlantic relationship is one which has expanded greatly in the last ten years - mostly, it is true, on the American side thanks to President Clinton; but I think that history will relate that there has also been a European contribution to this new relationship, which has been a fundamental key to the way in which it has worked, through the Transatlantic Declaration of 1990 and through the new Transatlantic Agenda under the Spanish Presidency in December 1995.
1765	So it will be important to change tack here and write a real Transatlantic Agenda for the year 2001.
1766	I will conclude with the Dominican Republic, which says: "The WTO was supposed to have been an impartial referee of common rules where countries could learn to play the game.
1767	Secondly, even if the retreat of the Communist threat is a cause for rejoicing, the collapse of the Soviet Union has left us with a single superpower in the form of the United States of America.
1768	I know he has a good and very constructive dialogue with Parliament and with the committees with an interest in these issues.
1769	The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
1770	These objectives, the main one and the secondary ones, will be the touchstone by which the concrete proposals submitted by the Commission must be judged.
1771	We know that a solution such as this - establishment in one country with the opportunity to provide services to the whole of the Union - could lead to an avalanche towards those countries with the lowest taxes.
1772	Thus, in 1992, an agreement was reached, at the time considered a minimum harmonisation, by which the standard rate for VAT could not be less than 15% and the Member States would have the power to apply one or more reduced rates of not less than 5%, with, however, derogations provided for in this case.
1773	We called for the European Commission to monitor to ensure that there is no distortion of the market and to report back to the Council and to Parliament.
1774	In short, the aim of this proposal is correct but the method is misconceived and if we really want to encourage Europe's e-economy, a right signal would be zero rate VAT for our own e-business rather than trying to impose our problems on others.
1775	If we are to be able to live up to the requirements for reduced emissions of greenhouse gases we must take every measure possible to limit them.
1776	The only instance in which no tax is levied is when the supplier is in a non-EU country and the recipient is in a Member State of the EU.
1777	Positive discrimination in favour of air transport must be abolished.
1778	Companies from countries which are not members of the EU are not taxed at all.
1779	Compact discs are not exactly antediluvian, and it would appear that these have to be taxed, whereas programmes circulating on the Internet are apparently to be exempt from tax.
1780	Nevertheless, the solution proposed will prove to be technically unmanageable and a barrier to the development of on-line transactions within the Union, at the very time when everybody is hoping for its expansion.
1781	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the tax systems of the Union are becoming ineffective and are yielding less and less revenue.
1782	We should be thinking out ways to encourage e-commerce and not thinking up new ways in which to tax it.
1783	Liberals tell us that as little State involvement as possible is required.
1784	The Primarolo group has devised simple rules which must be applied.
1785	By way of an objection, the Group that I represent in this House believes that we should correct the fact that, while newspapers normally enjoy reduced VAT rates, this reduction is not applicable to electronic newspapers.
1786	So the taxation of kerosene is only possible on the basis of an international consensus if a level playing-field is to be guaranteed.
1787	I particularly welcome the fact that the report reinforces one of the key points that I made in my report for the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism which this Parliament voted on a few months ago, namely, that since it is undoubtedly politically difficult to achieve international agreement on an aviation tax, at least in a short term, we should look at alternative tools to achieve the same effect, including an emissions charge.
1788	In fact, the industry pays 100% of its infrastructure costs through air traffic control and airport charges, amounting to US $4bn in 1998 - unlike other modes of transport, such as rail and road, which are still heavily subsidised.
1789	The current situation is an unfavourable one.
1790	In this context, I am sorry to say that aircraft emissions do pose a problem; although air traffic is not responsible for a large percentage of pollutant emissions, its volume is growing very rapidly, and we must therefore avoid any temptation to trivialise it.
1791	The scheme will be harmful to the development of SMEs, both within and outside the Union, especially in view of the proposed reduction of the exemption threshold to a prohibitively low level of EUR 40 000 annual turnover.
1792	If we are too greedy in this matter now under discussion we will really be jeopardising the future of e-business, which is so important for Europe.
1793	The guiding principle that suppliers from outside the Community who supply to customers within the Community need only register at one location must not lead to a shift in tax revenue between the Member States.
1794	Given that the debate in the Council is still under way and also given the Commission' s wish to bring the topic of VAT and e-commerce to a successful conclusion in the short term, I am of the opinion that at this moment in time, it would be desirable not to accept Parliament' s amendment proposals formally but to try to incorporate these proposals as far as possible in the negotiations with the Council.
1795	This is why I cannot accept the proposed amendments.
1796	Thank you very much for all the dossiers you have addressed this week.
1797	For its part, just three months after the accident, the Commission assumed its responsibilities and adopted a first package of measures, which the European Parliament approved fully on 30 November.
1798	In fact, with more than fifteen directives or regulations in force, it is crucial that we standardise practices and exercise greater control over the implementation of Community rules, in order to prevent significant and unacceptable differences in the field of maritime safety which could arise within the Union.
1799	Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for her continuing commitment in the field of maritime safety.
1800	I would like to remind Members that, in air safety, the amounts of compensation paid in Europe and North America are not equal to the amounts paid in other countries.
1801	Secondly, I would say that it is French law which will have the power to confiscate or freeze the assets of a specific company in order to compensate for damages or anything else, and it could establish liabilities beyond those laid down according to the objective criteria provided for in current international legislation on hydrocarbon pollution.
1802	The Commission considers that such adjustments go in the right direction towards the establishment of fairer charging systems which give also an incentive for a more rational and efficient use of the road network.
1803	That was changed in the face of criticism, especially from Ireland and France, and a different spin has now been put on it by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer: it is now being portrayed as a user charge for all, including British lorry drivers.
1804	I am committed to ensuring that the food consumers have available, whether it comes from within or outside the European Union, meets the highest standards.
1805	Naturally I understand the honourable Member's concern.
1806	I am sorry to have to tell you that I am not satisfied with your reply.
1807	The point that the honourable Member makes is an important one.
1808	In Nigeria, Chevron has been accused by the All-Ijaw indigenous people of instigating violence against them and actually paying Nigerian soldiers to shoot protesters at the Warri naval base.
1809	In its report adopted on 15 November the Commission concluded that operating aid under Regulation 1540/98 has not provided a solution to the problem of South Korean pricing practices.
1810	I believe that the intentions as a whole are hugely reassuring, but the reality is that meanwhile our dockyards are closing down.
1811	Question No 38 by (H-0868/00)
1812	Mr Commissioner, I can understand that you do not wish to change your decision despite the fact that ten Member States are against such a duty.
1813	This initiative is based upon a Council regulation amending the regulation which defines the current GSP.
1814	I represent some growers and I am thus very concerned indeed.
1815	We are working on these in committee, but no decisions were taken on the matter this week, as Poul Nielson was absent on a visit to the Balkans.
1816	The safeguard clause is currently being worked upon and, if Mr Clegg needs background arguments in order to talk with the sugar beet farmers, I shall make these available to him.
1817	I would like to thank Mr Liikanen for what was in all respects a very positive and excellent reply.
1818	I will discuss that issue with my services once the budget resources for next year are clear.
1819	At present, the efforts of myself and my offices are focused on limiting the effects which the distance between the parties and the future tribunal may have.
1820	Just as the law courts in DÃ¼sseldorf, Munich and elsewhere in Germany have specialised in the law of patents and there is also a specialised court in London, a Community court to sit upon and judge cases concerning Community patents would have to be very specialised.
1821	To prevent this provisional situation from turning into a permanent one, on 13 July of last year, the Commission reminded the Member States concerned in a letter, of their obligation to designate courts for the Community trade mark.
1822	As the honourable Member of your House is aware, the lodging of a complaint has in itself no bearing on the progress of the project.
1823	Question No 47 by (H-0877/00)
1824	This means therefore that the Commission will only deploy the legal aids it has at its disposal within the meaning of the regulation.
1825	The question is: who should these students apply to in order to confirm that, if they take these courses and complete their studies in Britain, they are entitled to have results?
1826	The king might be elected for a fixed period from among the most deserving Finnish MEPs!
1827	This can also be regarded as a competition-related issue, as duty-free goods can continue to be sold in the southern part of the Baltic on the crossing between Stockholm and Helsinki, whereas they are not permitted to be sold on the journey between UmeÃ¥ and Vasa.
1828	What we need to do is to rectify this situation by fostering and encouraging multilingual content, as this is absolutely crucial to the success of the European content industry.
1829	The problem I am mainly concerned with is that small enterprises do not always have sufficient guarantees and a proven business track record to offer investors.
1830	In order successfully to complete the ambitious development of this European e-content programme, the procedures envisaged need to be simplified and made secure.
1831	For that reason, the objective behind public subsidies for the EU' s content industry must also be the achievement of high levels of education and culture in all its diversity.
1832	On the other hand, we have the communications networks which need a constant supply of content in order to fill their web pages and which see nothing wrong in subordinating the content, in ransoming it and using it without paying any particular attention to the rules of production.
1833	Mr President, I very much welcome this e-content programme and should like to refer to two aspects of it.
1834	That is why I support the amendments calling for specific steps to be taken in the field of new technologies.
1835	First, on the social and cultural function of digital content, the Commission welcomes the fact that Parliament emphasises the social and cultural dimension of digital content.
1836	Assessment and management of environmental noise
1837	I am indeed grateful for the support which the Christian-Democrats and, in fact, part of the Liberal Group, have lent to this one specific amendment to curb all aircraft noise.
1838	Only this year, six years overdue, and under enormous pressure from the French Government, has the Commission at last proposed European harmonised noise indicators.
1839	It is a moderate proposal, for Scandinavia already has stricter standards in place than those proposed for the year 2012.
1840	Airports such as Orly, Schiphol and Barcelona already meet strict requirements.
1841	Another important proposal we have made, which will be of particular significance in the context of aviation noise, is that there should be an additional noise indicator over and above those that the rapporteur has enumerated.
1842	The lack of common standards in the European Union has caused situations of clearly unfair competition between airports and a lack of equality among the citizens of different Member States.
1843	That is why, in my opinion, the amendments tabled by Mr Bernd Lange are so important.
1844	Mr President, first of all I must say that I welcome this report.
1845	That, in principle, was the idea behind Amendment No 36, although I believe the idea has not been fully developed yet.
1846	We should examine that very carefully and then pursue the implementation of both parts of the combined approach, namely the establishment of limit values for the various sources of noise on the one hand and quality standards for noise sources on the other.
1847	We needed more time and I regret we did not have it even though I generally support the framework directive.
1848	Once Member States have provided the comparable information then the Commission will consider the question of Community limit values and other measures to reduce the numbers of people affected by noise and report back to the Council and Parliament.
1849	Additives other than colours and sweeteners
1850	These are the three criteria.
1851	Thank you Mrs Thyssen, I sympathise with you, for while you have a carrot in your throat, I have a frog in my throat, as we say north of the Rhine, but there is a bit of a flu bug going round in this House.
1852	Chronic dietary problems also increase the risk of cancer.
1853	It then also transpired that the Commission did not have the right tools to tackle the problem adequately.
1854	There is another stage scheduled for tomorrow, when Mrs Marit Paulsen from the Liberal Group will be at the helm and she will be given the chance to further tighten the present directive.
1855	Member States and the Commission now have a better instrument available to ensure that Community legislation in animal nutrition is properly enforced and, in the event of emergencies in third countries, rapid reactions are possible.
1856	We know that the vast majority of Europeans live in cities, and, until now, these matters, as far as cities specifically are concerned, have played second fiddle.
1857	The planning process must be implemented in a fair and innovative manner.
1858	The 2000-2004 multiannual programme for sustainable development in the urban environment is an appropriate instrument for achieving this end, and the implementation of Agenda 21 is an excellent way of coordinating and developing actions.
1859	Reduced traffic and conversion from fossil fuels at a local level is necessary to achieve a change in the climate threat we are experiencing.
1860	Many have suggested that the budget is too small.
1861	It is intended that the main partners in this framework should be the Commission and networks of local authorities whose legal responsibility is to develop and implement policies of sustainable urban development.
1862	The Court of Justice of the European Communities and even the WTO' s dispute settlement bodies consider that the precautionary principle is applicable in environmental or public health issues, occasionally even against the Europeans, as may be seen from the case (still pending) of cheese produced from milk straight from the cow.
1863	Damage limitation and compensation must not be our aim; our paramount goal must be to prevent damage to people's health and property.
1864	As long ago as 1996 the European Parliament came out in favour of a ban on the use of meat-and-bone meal throughout the European Union in accordance with the precautionary principle - if only.
1865	There is no such thing as absolute scientific certainty about new substances or products, nor can there ever be.
1866	Finally if the precautionary principle is to be applied effectively and credibly, it is vital to involve all key stakeholders, including representatives of civil society in the policy choices that surround its application.
1867	And lastly, that public health and the environment must be given priority over all other considerations, particularly financial considerations.
1868	In order to apply the precautionary principle, it is absolutely essential to provide a scientific basis for the concern about possible harmful effects.
1869	Only yesterday in Lisbon, the American professor, George Carlo, who for the last seven years has been entrusted by the Food and Drugs Administration with a study on the effect of the radiation on human health, revealed at first hand that there is the risk that the use of mobile phones might promote the appearance of brain tumours, Alzheimer' s disease and skin lesions.
1870	Mr President, the environment and public health are like a complex machine with many functions that we monitor and check in order to be able to intervene to make sure that things do not go wrong.
1871	What must at all costs be avoided is a situation in which the application of this principle curbs innovation and economic activity, creates undue caution and resistance to change on the part of industry and becomes a means of discouraging competition.
1872	Parliament must have noted that the Commission is in line with most of the issues raised in your motion for a resolution.
1873	The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.
1874	Article 2 of the Charter enshrines the right to life, and each time someone is killed by terrorism in Spain, the whole of the European Union senses the relevance of what is one of its most crucial principles.
1875	We do not wish to replace the legitimately established institutions, but we wish to persuade them to protect our rights and freedoms without making concessions to terrorists.
1876	VOTE
1877	She also recalled the Council's observation concerning the classification of budget headings for the Commission's pre-retirement plan and for administrative expenditure on fisheries agreements.
1878	(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
1879	I believe this is something of an anachronism!
1880	Although it is likely that they will consider the number 23 428 far too low, they will nevertheless be pleased with the room for growth provided to them.
1881	This abolition, which began to take place in the middle of last year, as we had anticipated, resulted in a dramatic fall in the speed with which projects were approved and payments made, to the point where the annual implementation of authorisations of this fund at the end of June 2000 was less than one per cent.
1882	This paragraph is a perfect carte blanche for the effective closure of the Secretariat-General of the European Parliament in Luxembourg.
1883	Before I left for Strasbourg, the pensioners and elderly people of Bergamo said to me: 'Christmas is coming and we in Bergamo celebrate both Christmas and the feast day of St Lucy.
1884	Moreover, we are highly critical of the over-production of agricultural produce and of the use of information funds by the EU to sell this surplus.
1885	Mr President, I voted for the GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil report on the taxation of electronic commerce.
1886	Mr President, I will do my best to remedy this before 2004 with a few explanations of votes in favour of Malta.
1887	Nevertheless, I must say quite seriously that this is as much as I can accept from a Europe which I feel to be too liberal!
1888	A fixed date would act as an incentive for the post office to develop and modernise its services and would make planning and market investment easier.
1889	They will keep the pressure on, and they are strengthening their position with the revenue they are generating from delivering mail above 150 grams.
1890	The liberalisation of postal services on the terms proposed by the Commission is neither appropriate nor consistent, and I therefore voted in favour of the report and all the amendments moved that expressed this position.
1891	de Roo report (A5-0378/2000)
1892	We also have reservations on Amendments Nos 17, 18, 27, 30 and 31, being not convinced that they are WTO compatible.
1893	This is a form of globalisation that scorns the most basic human rights.
1894	This is said to be in conflict with respect for national identity (Article 6(3) of the Treaty on European Union).
1895	It must be emphasised that linguistic minorities, rather than being overwhelmed by the globalisation brought about by the Internet, have discovered that it opens up new cultural and economic horizons.
1896	Mr President, in the absence of any other results, the horse-trading in Nice has at least clearly shown the intentions of the European Union' s key players.
1897	In this respect, the tenor of the common resolution is far too one-sided.
1898	The delay in the publication of the written conclusions - which are still not officially available, four days later - is a good illustration of the difficulty in clearly drawing up decisions taken in a state of confusion.
1899	The only way of preventing dangerous conflicts in future is to adhere to the traditional concept, according to which Europe is founded on mutual respect between national communities.
1900	The Nice Summit concluded on Sunday with an agreement that should lead to a draft treaty.
1901	The resolution on Nice, voted today, does not reflect this.
1902	Lastly a mention of social policy, which France had backed when it opened its Presidency, but which ended up amounting to very little, apart from the declarations of intent and the titles of documents with very vague contents which clearly did not match up to the existing problems and the enormous discontent, of which the workers' demonstration in Nice was also a major expression.
1903	In the really important areas such as taxes, public levies, social policy, asylum and immigration, the old order has evidently survived.
1904	The amazing thing about the debate on Nice is the image that, when all is said and done, the Treaty has no father or mother but is nobody' s child: the French Presidency has fallen over backwards giving excuses instead of plainly accepting the results of the IGC and the reasons for them; the political groups corresponding to the Member States' governments have done all they can to criticise.
1905	On the contrary, the influence of the national democracies is being reduced by the further restriction of the right of veto and by the fact that the European Parliament is being given more power.
1906	If those effects had been foreseen in the year I was born (1944) when the Chicago Convention was concluded, it is unlikely that tax exemption for fuel and other aircraft necessities would have been agreed upon.
1907	As there is no such thing as zero risk, scientists - or at least politicians - should apply the criterion of proportionality, consider there to be risks and assume their responsibilities.
1908	The House had also fought, however, for the reduction of the funds available for innovative measures to be offset by means of resources from the flexibility instrument, a demand which is recorded in a declaration on the financial perspective in the Interinstitutional Agreement.
1909	All have a role to play in this important area for, in the truly global market which is now upon us, it is the new ideas - properly resourced, cogently and realistically supported - which will ensure that we in Europe can maintain our place at the forefront of technological development in the new industries and in communications technology in particular.
1910	Regarding the budget, some serious words were said here in the previous speech: EUR 400 million is really just the minimum for financing, and we will have to utilise the additional financial possibilities offered by the flexibility instrument in the second half of the period, as the report states.
1911	Contrary to what the report concludes, I do not believe that this would automatically result in a loss of any European added value.
1912	As we all know, unemployment in the European Union is concentrated in the least economically and technologically developed regions, especially Objective 1 areas, and it is necessary that innovative measures should not just simply be technological in nature but that they should also be governed by an explicit desire for economic development and job creation.
1913	When I go back to my own region, east of England, and find that not one local authority used this money in that last period, I doubt whether we have been as effective as we need to be in the future to ensure those new communities are welcomed in.
1914	Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank and congratulate Helmuth Markov on his constructive, extremely competent and serious presentation of the draft communication on these innovative measures under the ERDF for the period 2000-2006.
1915	Energy efficiency and aspects of environmental policy have not been overlooked in the guidelines and may give rise to innovative measures relating to the third issue, which is regional identity and sustainable development.
1916	However, we wish projects to be selected at regional level, as Mr Berend understood in his intervention.
1917	The debate is closed.
1918	That is why, in this report and the three additional motions on the table, we have called on the Commission to intensify its efforts to ensure that an international dispute-settlement procedure is initiated before the WTO.
1919	It seems to me that the Commissioner must show the industry that he is doing all he can in this context to deal with this external threat to our industry.
1920	Finally, as from 18 December, we are, of course, counting on the 'ships arrangement' being examined at the OECD Group 6 meeting.
1921	However, it looks very much as if the goal posts are being moved each time, so that we will never reach the finishing line.
1922	As you all know, it will take more than six months to carry out this procedure.
1923	When big trusts and their political advocates call for less state interference, what they mean is that the state and its money should be solely at their disposal.
1924	But in order to achieve that, so that the process may consolidate the shipbuilding industry and its jobs and calm the fears of the families which depend on it, aid will still be necessary beyond 31 December 2000, because the market situation is not one of equality, but of unfairness and of dumping.
1925	Improving competitiveness of the EU yards is encouraged by the Commission but, in the face of massive price undercutting by Korean yards, the achievable progress in productivity is not sufficient.
1926	The Council emphasised that such a support mechanism must not distort competition inside the EU.
1927	The presence of a broken down nuclear submarine in the waters of the Bay of Algeciras has now unfortunately become a diplomatic conflict between a colonial and nuclear military power and a second category Member State, according to the latest classification in Nice, which does not demand its rights and gives in to infantile explanations.
1928	When, by means of the medical dispatch which they distributed in the country where the owner lived - that is, by means of the British press - it was discovered that the illness was serious, instead of changing hospitals, they changed the classification of the hospital.
1929	Of course, we await the Commission' s reply with great interest, in order to see whether the objective has been fulfilled.
1930	Mr President, I would also like to start by offering my condolences to the family of the murdered councillor and to the Members from the Popular Party, and I wish to reject this fascist barbarity of ETA and of the groups which support it.
1931	I also believe that the submarine Tireless should be taken to Great Britain to be repaired as soon as possible, as soon as the weather conditions are suitable.
1932	Honourable Members have asked whether the Commission considers that Directives 89/618/Euratom, on informing the public in the event of radiological emergency, and 96/29/Euratom on basic safety standards, apply in relation to the submarine and what steps have been taken accordingly.
1933	Under the usual complaints procedure, we are not entitled to make this reply public, although we can say broadly what it says.
1934	There is one aspect of the Euratom Treaty which is the transport of contaminated waste between Member States of the European Union; but, of course, Gibraltar is part of the United Kingdom and any contaminated waste will go from one part of the United Kingdom to another part of the United Kingdom, without passing through any other Member State in the European Union.
1935	All they have to do is to gain the confidence of the Gibraltarian people who live on the Rock.
1936	Well, here is an example of one Member State treating public opinion in another Member State just as it would in any other country in the world, just as if, at the end of the day, there were no affectio societatis fifty years after the start of the European project, just as if European solidarity had made no progress whatsoever.
1937	It is a fact that at one stage the only submarine operating in British waters was a German U-boat.
1938	A debate is taking place there, but the citizens, on the basis of their knowledge or intuition, are turning their attention to the European institutions.
1939	Lack of spending on new military hardware because of defence cuts by the British Labour government will no doubt in future result in more frequent episodes of defective military equipment being taken out of service for essential repairs.
1940	Community competence, however much some people may wish it otherwise, does not extend to the classification of ports to carry out repair work on submarines, questions of technical safety of nuclear reactors and requirements on a submarine to be removed for repair elsewhere.
1941	If we want to help them even more, we should call on the Community institutions to increase the financial, human and material resources of the UNHCR.
1942	I would ask the Commission to re-instate this aid to the UNHCR and also to designate the UNHCR as the coordinating body in all its contracts with NGOs.
1943	It should therefore have access to civil victims and its teams on the ground should be able to work in complete safety and with all the resources needed to carry out their mission.
1944	On 22 November the Commission adopted a communication on a common asylum procedure and a uniform status for those granted asylum valid throughout the Union, which is the final aim fixed in Tampere for the common European asylum system.
1945	Finally, I should like to pay a tribute to all the work that has been done by Mrs Ogata for the UNHCR and to wish Mr Ruud Lubbers well in his new post.
1946	It seems to us important that we are promoting a political amnesty in Yugoslavia for that recuperation I mentioned, but it also seems to us very important that we roundly condemn the recurrence of incursions and terrorist activities on the borders between Serbia, Albania and Kosovo, because that is a worrying reminder of what happened during the Kosovo conflict, where Western powers held responsibilities.
1947	Our compromise resolution is clearly stipulated in Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3.
1948	I also appeal to President Kostunica to find out what happened to people such as Mr Ukshin Hoti, with whose fate we have concerned ourselves on several occasions here without ever obtaining any information on his whereabouts.
1949	I also agree with the request for help from KFOR to thwart further violence in the Presevo valley.
1950	I welcome steps now taken by KFOR to tackle the problem and continue to urge restraint on all sides.
1951	B5-0916/2000 by BarÃ³n Crespo and others, on behalf of the PSE Group;
1952	This clause was agreed in the Palacio de la Moneda in March 1990, and I am well aware of this because I had the privilege of being there when President Alwyn took over, following the vote which put an end to General Pinochet' s regime.
1953	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to say a few words on the joint resolution, which will, of course, be passed.
1954	The international community must exercise its right of democratic vigilance, not in order to interfere in the internal affairs of an independent country but as a precautionary and preventative political procedure.
1955	The situation in prisons and police stations is entirely unacceptable and includes extensive abuse and torture.
1956	This treatment would be exactly like we see in Western Europe and, faced with the protests, the Minister Hikmet Sami Turk has postponed the transfer so that a social and political consensus upon prison reform be developed throughout Turkey.
1957	Action is needed quickly, which is why we decided to include this item on the agenda.
1958	He will stand trial on 8 January on charges of having attended a meeting of the Tunisian opposition in France, which he denies.
1959	When militants and those in charge of these associations decide to meet in order to celebrate the anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, their houses are surrounded by police and anyone trying to enter is harassed in the street by men dressed in civilian clothes.
1960	The second problem is actually only part of a pattern of harassment.
1961	My Group, like this Parliament, is particularly sensitive about the human rights situation in Tunisia and in the rest of the world.
1962	Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us not get carried away, please.
1963	The negotiations went extremely well and I am delighted that we are picking up momentum in those negotiations, which I hope will have the conclusion which the honourable Member referred to.
1964	Several honourable Members referred to the situation of prisoners in Turkey.
1965	B5-0912/2000 by Van Hecke, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group;
1966	Mr President, Commissioner, we must not stand by and watch.
1967	It was in this context that the military took power, which, as ever, only helped to aggravate the situation.
1968	This attitude is descended directly from France' s imperialist policy.
1969	The Commission is also very concerned by the recent violence.
1970	The debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed.
1971	Unfair competition could help destroy good shipbuilding environments and lead to the loss of know-how and jobs; in the long term it could result in a monopoly situation, which would not be beneficial to world trade.
1972	Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
1973	I therefore thank all my colleagues for their contributions, including those made at the amendments stage, and also the committee's experts, for these contributions were very valuable for the finalisation of the resolution.
1974	We were delighted that the European Council in Nice adopted the social agenda and we hope that the Member States will take this opportunity to promote the development and coordination of social security and welfare systems for the elderly and to promote other measures, such as lifelong learning, which ensure that they have an active lifestyle.
1975	Promoting life-long learning - a topic that has already been mentioned by another speaker - is a matter I also support.
1976	Needless to say, people above the age of 60 or 70 can still do many useful things, but it is wrong at that age to make their income dependent on completed working hours.
1977	In its monthly report for July 2000, the European Central Bank as already issuing serious warnings.
1978	In my opinion, it would be preferable for Member States to address this problem by using their own legislative instruments.
1979	Thanks to her proposals for an active old age, society is enriched by a whole generation.
1980	Promises regarding pensions must be kept, but pensions must be secured with those countries' own funds without payment of the pension being protected at the expense of the EU' s common monetary policy.
1981	Over the last 100 to 150 years we have experienced the greatest social revolution of all time, for our human life span has doubled.
1982	This alone gives meaning to the mathematical prolongation of life made possible by medical progress.
1983	They accepted payments - the whole of society was therefore involved - and older workers retired, but younger workers were not taken on and many jobs were shed.
1984	Family and tax policy should be designed to ensure that men and women who have family commitments are free to decide whether they wish to go out to work or not.
1985	My brother and I joined him there.
1986	Future initiatives in the field of public health are directed more at health- and care-related issues in old age and at promoting healthy ageing.
1987	Mr President, I have accepted both Amendment No 2 and Amendment No 3 tabled by Mr Pronk, in which he calls for the text to be amended and insists on the concept of development of the population rather than ageing of the population.
1988	It avoids overlap with the advertising and promotional activities of businesses in the sectors and of public authorities.
1989	Mr President, in principle, the Committee on Budgets backs the Commission proposal too.
1990	That is why it is very important to achieve a balance here, and this can be developed very effectively through the promotion and publicity measures.
1991	I believe that where marketing, sales and training programmes are concerned, life-long learning ought to take centre stage much more, because it is precisely the new technologies - handling product promotion using modern logistics - which will open up entirely new possibilities.
1992	First of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Dary on his good report.
1993	The fact that there are alternatives is something which Mr Garot showed in his report when, for once, with pigs, we tried to develop a market organisation which was actually designed to benefit farming and safeguard farming structures.
1994	No special payments must be made for products for which there is no demand, and the latter must not be advertised.
1995	Everyone has sufficient food, so if we advertise one product it will obviously militate against the consumption of another product.
1996	It can also accept Amendment No 18 and the first part of Amendment No 24, which reduce the time interval at which the eligible themes and products are reviewed from three to two years, so as to improve the efficiency of the promotional tool.
1997	In the Greek text Mrs Jutta Haug is referred to as a male rapporteur and Mr Markus Ferber is referred to as a female rapporteur.
1998	Here we can see how small changes can yield considerable results in practice.
1999	This is the last Friday sitting in Strasbourg for the time being, which means that Strasbourg will lose 12 days of parliamentary sittings.
2000	Finally, I would like to extend seasonal greetings to everyone, especially those few who have taken the trouble to attend this last Friday session of the year 2000 in Strasbourg, and to wish you all a good and, above all, wise new century.
