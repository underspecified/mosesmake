Secondly, I would say that it is French law which will have the power to confiscate or freeze the assets of a specific company in order to compensate for damages or anything else, and it could establish liabilities beyond those laid down according to the objective criteria provided for in current international legislation on hydrocarbon pollution.
The Commission considers that such adjustments go in the right direction towards the establishment of fairer charging systems which give also an incentive for a more rational and efficient use of the road network.
That was changed in the face of criticism, especially from Ireland and France, and a different spin has now been put on it by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer: it is now being portrayed as a user charge for all, including British lorry drivers.
I am committed to ensuring that the food consumers have available, whether it comes from within or outside the European Union, meets the highest standards.
Naturally I understand the honourable Member's concern.
I am sorry to have to tell you that I am not satisfied with your reply.
The point that the honourable Member makes is an important one.
In Nigeria, Chevron has been accused by the All-Ijaw indigenous people of instigating violence against them and actually paying Nigerian soldiers to shoot protesters at the Warri naval base.
In its report adopted on 15 November the Commission concluded that operating aid under Regulation 1540/98 has not provided a solution to the problem of South Korean pricing practices.
I believe that the intentions as a whole are hugely reassuring, but the reality is that meanwhile our dockyards are closing down.
Question No 38 by (H-0868/00)
Mr Commissioner, I can understand that you do not wish to change your decision despite the fact that ten Member States are against such a duty.
This initiative is based upon a Council regulation amending the regulation which defines the current GSP.
I represent some growers and I am thus very concerned indeed.
We are working on these in committee, but no decisions were taken on the matter this week, as Poul Nielson was absent on a visit to the Balkans.
The safeguard clause is currently being worked upon and, if Mr Clegg needs background arguments in order to talk with the sugar beet farmers, I shall make these available to him.
I would like to thank Mr Liikanen for what was in all respects a very positive and excellent reply.
I will discuss that issue with my services once the budget resources for next year are clear.
At present, the efforts of myself and my offices are focused on limiting the effects which the distance between the parties and the future tribunal may have.
Just as the law courts in Düsseldorf, Munich and elsewhere in Germany have specialised in the law of patents and there is also a specialised court in London, a Community court to sit upon and judge cases concerning Community patents would have to be very specialised.
To prevent this provisional situation from turning into a permanent one, on 13 July of last year, the Commission reminded the Member States concerned in a letter, of their obligation to designate courts for the Community trade mark.
As the honourable Member of your House is aware, the lodging of a complaint has in itself no bearing on the progress of the project.
Question No 47 by (H-0877/00)
This means therefore that the Commission will only deploy the legal aids it has at its disposal within the meaning of the regulation.
The question is: who should these students apply to in order to confirm that, if they take these courses and complete their studies in Britain, they are entitled to have results?
The king might be elected for a fixed period from among the most deserving Finnish MEPs!
This can also be regarded as a competition-related issue, as duty-free goods can continue to be sold in the southern part of the Baltic on the crossing between Stockholm and Helsinki, whereas they are not permitted to be sold on the journey between Umeå and Vasa.
What we need to do is to rectify this situation by fostering and encouraging multilingual content, as this is absolutely crucial to the success of the European content industry.
The problem I am mainly concerned with is that small enterprises do not always have sufficient guarantees and a proven business track record to offer investors.
In order successfully to complete the ambitious development of this European e-content programme, the procedures envisaged need to be simplified and made secure.
For that reason, the objective behind public subsidies for the EU' s content industry must also be the achievement of high levels of education and culture in all its diversity.
On the other hand, we have the communications networks which need a constant supply of content in order to fill their web pages and which see nothing wrong in subordinating the content, in ransoming it and using it without paying any particular attention to the rules of production.
Mr President, I very much welcome this e-content programme and should like to refer to two aspects of it.
That is why I support the amendments calling for specific steps to be taken in the field of new technologies.
First, on the social and cultural function of digital content, the Commission welcomes the fact that Parliament emphasises the social and cultural dimension of digital content.
Assessment and management of environmental noise
I am indeed grateful for the support which the Christian-Democrats and, in fact, part of the Liberal Group, have lent to this one specific amendment to curb all aircraft noise.
Only this year, six years overdue, and under enormous pressure from the French Government, has the Commission at last proposed European harmonised noise indicators.
It is a moderate proposal, for Scandinavia already has stricter standards in place than those proposed for the year 2012.
Airports such as Orly, Schiphol and Barcelona already meet strict requirements.
Another important proposal we have made, which will be of particular significance in the context of aviation noise, is that there should be an additional noise indicator over and above those that the rapporteur has enumerated.
The lack of common standards in the European Union has caused situations of clearly unfair competition between airports and a lack of equality among the citizens of different Member States.
That is why, in my opinion, the amendments tabled by Mr Bernd Lange are so important.
Mr President, first of all I must say that I welcome this report.
That, in principle, was the idea behind Amendment No 36, although I believe the idea has not been fully developed yet.
We should examine that very carefully and then pursue the implementation of both parts of the combined approach, namely the establishment of limit values for the various sources of noise on the one hand and quality standards for noise sources on the other.
We needed more time and I regret we did not have it even though I generally support the framework directive.
Once Member States have provided the comparable information then the Commission will consider the question of Community limit values and other measures to reduce the numbers of people affected by noise and report back to the Council and Parliament.
Additives other than colours and sweeteners
These are the three criteria.
Thank you Mrs Thyssen, I sympathise with you, for while you have a carrot in your throat, I have a frog in my throat, as we say north of the Rhine, but there is a bit of a flu bug going round in this House.
Chronic dietary problems also increase the risk of cancer.
It then also transpired that the Commission did not have the right tools to tackle the problem adequately.
There is another stage scheduled for tomorrow, when Mrs Marit Paulsen from the Liberal Group will be at the helm and she will be given the chance to further tighten the present directive.
Member States and the Commission now have a better instrument available to ensure that Community legislation in animal nutrition is properly enforced and, in the event of emergencies in third countries, rapid reactions are possible.
We know that the vast majority of Europeans live in cities, and, until now, these matters, as far as cities specifically are concerned, have played second fiddle.
The planning process must be implemented in a fair and innovative manner.
The 2000-2004 multiannual programme for sustainable development in the urban environment is an appropriate instrument for achieving this end, and the implementation of Agenda 21 is an excellent way of coordinating and developing actions.
Reduced traffic and conversion from fossil fuels at a local level is necessary to achieve a change in the climate threat we are experiencing.
Many have suggested that the budget is too small.
It is intended that the main partners in this framework should be the Commission and networks of local authorities whose legal responsibility is to develop and implement policies of sustainable urban development.
The Court of Justice of the European Communities and even the WTO' s dispute settlement bodies consider that the precautionary principle is applicable in environmental or public health issues, occasionally even against the Europeans, as may be seen from the case (still pending) of cheese produced from milk straight from the cow.
Damage limitation and compensation must not be our aim; our paramount goal must be to prevent damage to people's health and property.
As long ago as 1996 the European Parliament came out in favour of a ban on the use of meat-and-bone meal throughout the European Union in accordance with the precautionary principle - if only.
There is no such thing as absolute scientific certainty about new substances or products, nor can there ever be.
Finally if the precautionary principle is to be applied effectively and credibly, it is vital to involve all key stakeholders, including representatives of civil society in the policy choices that surround its application.
And lastly, that public health and the environment must be given priority over all other considerations, particularly financial considerations.
In order to apply the precautionary principle, it is absolutely essential to provide a scientific basis for the concern about possible harmful effects.
Only yesterday in Lisbon, the American professor, George Carlo, who for the last seven years has been entrusted by the Food and Drugs Administration with a study on the effect of the radiation on human health, revealed at first hand that there is the risk that the use of mobile phones might promote the appearance of brain tumours, Alzheimer' s disease and skin lesions.
Mr President, the environment and public health are like a complex machine with many functions that we monitor and check in order to be able to intervene to make sure that things do not go wrong.
What must at all costs be avoided is a situation in which the application of this principle curbs innovation and economic activity, creates undue caution and resistance to change on the part of industry and becomes a means of discouraging competition.
Parliament must have noted that the Commission is in line with most of the issues raised in your motion for a resolution.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Article 2 of the Charter enshrines the right to life, and each time someone is killed by terrorism in Spain, the whole of the European Union senses the relevance of what is one of its most crucial principles.
We do not wish to replace the legitimately established institutions, but we wish to persuade them to protect our rights and freedoms without making concessions to terrorists.

She also recalled the Council's observation concerning the classification of budget headings for the Commission's pre-retirement plan and for administrative expenditure on fisheries agreements.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
I believe this is something of an anachronism!
Although it is likely that they will consider the number 23 428 far too low, they will nevertheless be pleased with the room for growth provided to them.
This abolition, which began to take place in the middle of last year, as we had anticipated, resulted in a dramatic fall in the speed with which projects were approved and payments made, to the point where the annual implementation of authorisations of this fund at the end of June 2000 was less than one per cent.
This paragraph is a perfect carte blanche for the effective closure of the Secretariat-General of the European Parliament in Luxembourg.
Before I left for Strasbourg, the pensioners and elderly people of Bergamo said to me: 'Christmas is coming and we in Bergamo celebrate both Christmas and the feast day of St Lucy.
Moreover, we are highly critical of the over-production of agricultural produce and of the use of information funds by the EU to sell this surplus.
Mr President, I voted for the García-Margallo y Marfil report on the taxation of electronic commerce.
Mr President, I will do my best to remedy this before 2004 with a few explanations of votes in favour of Malta.
Nevertheless, I must say quite seriously that this is as much as I can accept from a Europe which I feel to be too liberal!
A fixed date would act as an incentive for the post office to develop and modernise its services and would make planning and market investment easier.
They will keep the pressure on, and they are strengthening their position with the revenue they are generating from delivering mail above 150 grams.
The liberalisation of postal services on the terms proposed by the Commission is neither appropriate nor consistent, and I therefore voted in favour of the report and all the amendments moved that expressed this position.
de Roo report (A5-0378/2000)
We also have reservations on Amendments Nos 17, 18, 27, 30 and 31, being not convinced that they are WTO compatible.
This is a form of globalisation that scorns the most basic human rights.
This is said to be in conflict with respect for national identity (Article 6(3) of the Treaty on European Union).
It must be emphasised that linguistic minorities, rather than being overwhelmed by the globalisation brought about by the Internet, have discovered that it opens up new cultural and economic horizons.
Mr President, in the absence of any other results, the horse-trading in Nice has at least clearly shown the intentions of the European Union' s key players.
In this respect, the tenor of the common resolution is far too one-sided.
The delay in the publication of the written conclusions - which are still not officially available, four days later - is a good illustration of the difficulty in clearly drawing up decisions taken in a state of confusion.
The only way of preventing dangerous conflicts in future is to adhere to the traditional concept, according to which Europe is founded on mutual respect between national communities.
The Nice Summit concluded on Sunday with an agreement that should lead to a draft treaty.
