The resolution on Nice, voted today, does not reflect this.
Lastly a mention of social policy, which France had backed when it opened its Presidency, but which ended up amounting to very little, apart from the declarations of intent and the titles of documents with very vague contents which clearly did not match up to the existing problems and the enormous discontent, of which the workers' demonstration in Nice was also a major expression.
In the really important areas such as taxes, public levies, social policy, asylum and immigration, the old order has evidently survived.
The amazing thing about the debate on Nice is the image that, when all is said and done, the Treaty has no father or mother but is nobody' s child: the French Presidency has fallen over backwards giving excuses instead of plainly accepting the results of the IGC and the reasons for them; the political groups corresponding to the Member States' governments have done all they can to criticise.
On the contrary, the influence of the national democracies is being reduced by the further restriction of the right of veto and by the fact that the European Parliament is being given more power.
If those effects had been foreseen in the year I was born (1944) when the Chicago Convention was concluded, it is unlikely that tax exemption for fuel and other aircraft necessities would have been agreed upon.
As there is no such thing as zero risk, scientists - or at least politicians - should apply the criterion of proportionality, consider there to be risks and assume their responsibilities.
The House had also fought, however, for the reduction of the funds available for innovative measures to be offset by means of resources from the flexibility instrument, a demand which is recorded in a declaration on the financial perspective in the Interinstitutional Agreement.
All have a role to play in this important area for, in the truly global market which is now upon us, it is the new ideas - properly resourced, cogently and realistically supported - which will ensure that we in Europe can maintain our place at the forefront of technological development in the new industries and in communications technology in particular.
Regarding the budget, some serious words were said here in the previous speech: EUR 400 million is really just the minimum for financing, and we will have to utilise the additional financial possibilities offered by the flexibility instrument in the second half of the period, as the report states.
Contrary to what the report concludes, I do not believe that this would automatically result in a loss of any European added value.
As we all know, unemployment in the European Union is concentrated in the least economically and technologically developed regions, especially Objective 1 areas, and it is necessary that innovative measures should not just simply be technological in nature but that they should also be governed by an explicit desire for economic development and job creation.
When I go back to my own region, east of England, and find that not one local authority used this money in that last period, I doubt whether we have been as effective as we need to be in the future to ensure those new communities are welcomed in.
Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank and congratulate Helmuth Markov on his constructive, extremely competent and serious presentation of the draft communication on these innovative measures under the ERDF for the period 2000-2006.
Energy efficiency and aspects of environmental policy have not been overlooked in the guidelines and may give rise to innovative measures relating to the third issue, which is regional identity and sustainable development.
However, we wish projects to be selected at regional level, as Mr Berend understood in his intervention.
The debate is closed.
That is why, in this report and the three additional motions on the table, we have called on the Commission to intensify its efforts to ensure that an international dispute-settlement procedure is initiated before the WTO.
It seems to me that the Commissioner must show the industry that he is doing all he can in this context to deal with this external threat to our industry.
Finally, as from 18 December, we are, of course, counting on the 'ships arrangement' being examined at the OECD Group 6 meeting.
However, it looks very much as if the goal posts are being moved each time, so that we will never reach the finishing line.
As you all know, it will take more than six months to carry out this procedure.
When big trusts and their political advocates call for less state interference, what they mean is that the state and its money should be solely at their disposal.
But in order to achieve that, so that the process may consolidate the shipbuilding industry and its jobs and calm the fears of the families which depend on it, aid will still be necessary beyond 31 December 2000, because the market situation is not one of equality, but of unfairness and of dumping.
Improving competitiveness of the EU yards is encouraged by the Commission but, in the face of massive price undercutting by Korean yards, the achievable progress in productivity is not sufficient.
The Council emphasised that such a support mechanism must not distort competition inside the EU.
The presence of a broken down nuclear submarine in the waters of the Bay of Algeciras has now unfortunately become a diplomatic conflict between a colonial and nuclear military power and a second category Member State, according to the latest classification in Nice, which does not demand its rights and gives in to infantile explanations.
When, by means of the medical dispatch which they distributed in the country where the owner lived - that is, by means of the British press - it was discovered that the illness was serious, instead of changing hospitals, they changed the classification of the hospital.
Of course, we await the Commission' s reply with great interest, in order to see whether the objective has been fulfilled.
Mr President, I would also like to start by offering my condolences to the family of the murdered councillor and to the Members from the Popular Party, and I wish to reject this fascist barbarity of ETA and of the groups which support it.
I also believe that the submarine Tireless should be taken to Great Britain to be repaired as soon as possible, as soon as the weather conditions are suitable.
Honourable Members have asked whether the Commission considers that Directives 89/618/Euratom, on informing the public in the event of radiological emergency, and 96/29/Euratom on basic safety standards, apply in relation to the submarine and what steps have been taken accordingly.
Under the usual complaints procedure, we are not entitled to make this reply public, although we can say broadly what it says.
There is one aspect of the Euratom Treaty which is the transport of contaminated waste between Member States of the European Union; but, of course, Gibraltar is part of the United Kingdom and any contaminated waste will go from one part of the United Kingdom to another part of the United Kingdom, without passing through any other Member State in the European Union.
All they have to do is to gain the confidence of the Gibraltarian people who live on the Rock.
Well, here is an example of one Member State treating public opinion in another Member State just as it would in any other country in the world, just as if, at the end of the day, there were no affectio societatis fifty years after the start of the European project, just as if European solidarity had made no progress whatsoever.
It is a fact that at one stage the only submarine operating in British waters was a German U-boat.
A debate is taking place there, but the citizens, on the basis of their knowledge or intuition, are turning their attention to the European institutions.
Lack of spending on new military hardware because of defence cuts by the British Labour government will no doubt in future result in more frequent episodes of defective military equipment being taken out of service for essential repairs.
Community competence, however much some people may wish it otherwise, does not extend to the classification of ports to carry out repair work on submarines, questions of technical safety of nuclear reactors and requirements on a submarine to be removed for repair elsewhere.
If we want to help them even more, we should call on the Community institutions to increase the financial, human and material resources of the UNHCR.
I would ask the Commission to re-instate this aid to the UNHCR and also to designate the UNHCR as the coordinating body in all its contracts with NGOs.
It should therefore have access to civil victims and its teams on the ground should be able to work in complete safety and with all the resources needed to carry out their mission.
On 22 November the Commission adopted a communication on a common asylum procedure and a uniform status for those granted asylum valid throughout the Union, which is the final aim fixed in Tampere for the common European asylum system.
Finally, I should like to pay a tribute to all the work that has been done by Mrs Ogata for the UNHCR and to wish Mr Ruud Lubbers well in his new post.
It seems to us important that we are promoting a political amnesty in Yugoslavia for that recuperation I mentioned, but it also seems to us very important that we roundly condemn the recurrence of incursions and terrorist activities on the borders between Serbia, Albania and Kosovo, because that is a worrying reminder of what happened during the Kosovo conflict, where Western powers held responsibilities.
Our compromise resolution is clearly stipulated in Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3.
I also appeal to President Kostunica to find out what happened to people such as Mr Ukshin Hoti, with whose fate we have concerned ourselves on several occasions here without ever obtaining any information on his whereabouts.
I also agree with the request for help from KFOR to thwart further violence in the Presevo valley.
I welcome steps now taken by KFOR to tackle the problem and continue to urge restraint on all sides.
B5-0916/2000 by Barón Crespo and others, on behalf of the PSE Group;
This clause was agreed in the Palacio de la Moneda in March 1990, and I am well aware of this because I had the privilege of being there when President Alwyn took over, following the vote which put an end to General Pinochet' s regime.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to say a few words on the joint resolution, which will, of course, be passed.
The international community must exercise its right of democratic vigilance, not in order to interfere in the internal affairs of an independent country but as a precautionary and preventative political procedure.
The situation in prisons and police stations is entirely unacceptable and includes extensive abuse and torture.
This treatment would be exactly like we see in Western Europe and, faced with the protests, the Minister Hikmet Sami Turk has postponed the transfer so that a social and political consensus upon prison reform be developed throughout Turkey.
Action is needed quickly, which is why we decided to include this item on the agenda.
He will stand trial on 8 January on charges of having attended a meeting of the Tunisian opposition in France, which he denies.
When militants and those in charge of these associations decide to meet in order to celebrate the anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, their houses are surrounded by police and anyone trying to enter is harassed in the street by men dressed in civilian clothes.
The second problem is actually only part of a pattern of harassment.
My Group, like this Parliament, is particularly sensitive about the human rights situation in Tunisia and in the rest of the world.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us not get carried away, please.
The negotiations went extremely well and I am delighted that we are picking up momentum in those negotiations, which I hope will have the conclusion which the honourable Member referred to.
Several honourable Members referred to the situation of prisoners in Turkey.
B5-0912/2000 by Van Hecke, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group;
Mr President, Commissioner, we must not stand by and watch.
It was in this context that the military took power, which, as ever, only helped to aggravate the situation.
This attitude is descended directly from France' s imperialist policy.
The Commission is also very concerned by the recent violence.
The debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed.
Unfair competition could help destroy good shipbuilding environments and lead to the loss of know-how and jobs; in the long term it could result in a monopoly situation, which would not be beneficial to world trade.
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
I therefore thank all my colleagues for their contributions, including those made at the amendments stage, and also the committee's experts, for these contributions were very valuable for the finalisation of the resolution.
We were delighted that the European Council in Nice adopted the social agenda and we hope that the Member States will take this opportunity to promote the development and coordination of social security and welfare systems for the elderly and to promote other measures, such as lifelong learning, which ensure that they have an active lifestyle.
Promoting life-long learning - a topic that has already been mentioned by another speaker - is a matter I also support.
Needless to say, people above the age of 60 or 70 can still do many useful things, but it is wrong at that age to make their income dependent on completed working hours.
In its monthly report for July 2000, the European Central Bank as already issuing serious warnings.
In my opinion, it would be preferable for Member States to address this problem by using their own legislative instruments.
Thanks to her proposals for an active old age, society is enriched by a whole generation.
Promises regarding pensions must be kept, but pensions must be secured with those countries' own funds without payment of the pension being protected at the expense of the EU' s common monetary policy.
Over the last 100 to 150 years we have experienced the greatest social revolution of all time, for our human life span has doubled.
This alone gives meaning to the mathematical prolongation of life made possible by medical progress.
They accepted payments - the whole of society was therefore involved - and older workers retired, but younger workers were not taken on and many jobs were shed.
Family and tax policy should be designed to ensure that men and women who have family commitments are free to decide whether they wish to go out to work or not.
My brother and I joined him there.
Future initiatives in the field of public health are directed more at health- and care-related issues in old age and at promoting healthy ageing.
Mr President, I have accepted both Amendment No 2 and Amendment No 3 tabled by Mr Pronk, in which he calls for the text to be amended and insists on the concept of development of the population rather than ageing of the population.
It avoids overlap with the advertising and promotional activities of businesses in the sectors and of public authorities.
Mr President, in principle, the Committee on Budgets backs the Commission proposal too.
That is why it is very important to achieve a balance here, and this can be developed very effectively through the promotion and publicity measures.
I believe that where marketing, sales and training programmes are concerned, life-long learning ought to take centre stage much more, because it is precisely the new technologies - handling product promotion using modern logistics - which will open up entirely new possibilities.
First of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Dary on his good report.
The fact that there are alternatives is something which Mr Garot showed in his report when, for once, with pigs, we tried to develop a market organisation which was actually designed to benefit farming and safeguard farming structures.
No special payments must be made for products for which there is no demand, and the latter must not be advertised.
Everyone has sufficient food, so if we advertise one product it will obviously militate against the consumption of another product.
It can also accept Amendment No 18 and the first part of Amendment No 24, which reduce the time interval at which the eligible themes and products are reviewed from three to two years, so as to improve the efficiency of the promotional tool.
In the Greek text Mrs Jutta Haug is referred to as a male rapporteur and Mr Markus Ferber is referred to as a female rapporteur.
Here we can see how small changes can yield considerable results in practice.
This is the last Friday sitting in Strasbourg for the time being, which means that Strasbourg will lose 12 days of parliamentary sittings.
Finally, I would like to extend seasonal greetings to everyone, especially those few who have taken the trouble to attend this last Friday session of the year 2000 in Strasbourg, and to wish you all a good and, above all, wise new century.
